SYNOPSIS

       g++ [ option | filename ]...

WARNING

       The  information  in  this man page is an extract from the
       full documentation of the GNU C compiler, and  is  limited
       to the meaning of the options.

       This  man  page  is not kept up to date except when volun-
       teers want to maintain it.   If  you  find  a  discrepancy
       between  the  man  page and the software, please check the
       Info file, which is the authoritative documentation.

       If we find that the things in this man page that  are  out
       of date cause significant confusion or complaints, we will
       stop distributing the man page.  The alternative, updating
       the  man  page when we update the Info file, is impossible
       because the rest of the work of maintaining GNU CC  leaves
       us no time for that.  The GNU project regards man pages as
       obsolete and should not let them take time away from other
       things.

       For  complete and current documentation, refer to the Info
       file `gcc' or the manual Using and  Porting  GNU  CC  (for
       version  2.0).  Both are made from the Texinfo source file
       gcc.texinfo.

DESCRIPTION

       The C and C++  compilers  are  integrated.   Both  process
       input  files  through  one or more of four stages: prepro-
       cessing, compilation, assembly, and linking.  Source file-
       name suffixes identify the source language, but which name
       you use for the compiler governs default assumptions:

       gcc    assumes preprocessed (.i) files are C and assumes C
              style linking.

       g++    assumes preprocessed (.i) files are C++ and assumes
              C++ style linking.

       Suffixes of source file names indicate  the  language  and
       kind of processing to be done:

       .c    C source; preprocess, compile, assemble
       .C    C++ source; preprocess, compile, assemble
       .cc   C++ source; preprocess, compile, assemble
       .cxx  C++ source; preprocess, compile, assemble
       .m    Objective-C source; preprocess, compile, assemble
       .i    preprocessed C; compile, assemble
       .ii   preprocessed C++; compile, assemble

       Linking is always the last stage unless you use one of the
       -c,  -S,  or -E options to avoid it (or unless compilation
       errors stop the whole process).  For the link  stage,  all
       .o  files  corresponding  to  source  files, -l libraries,
       unrecognized filenames (including named  .o  object  files
       and  .a archives) are passed to the linker in command-line
       order.

OPTIONS

       Options must be separate: `-dr' is  quite  different  from
       `-d -r '.

       Most `-f' and `-W' options have two contrary forms: -fname
       and -fno-name (or -Wname and -Wno-name).   Only  the  non-
       default forms are shown here.

       Here  is  a  summary  of all the options, grouped by type.
       Explanations are in the following sections.

FreeBSD SPECIFIC OPTIONS

       -pthread
              Link a user-threaded process against libc_r instead
              of libc. Objects linked into user-threaded process-
              es should be compiled with -D_THREAD_SAFE.
              `objective-c',  `c-header',  `c++',   `cpp-output',
              `assembler', and `assembler-with-cpp'.

       -x none
              Turn  off  any specification of a language, so that
              subsequent files are  handled  according  to  their
              file  name  suffixes  (as  they are if `-x' has not
              been used at all).

       If you want only some of the four stages (preprocess, com-
       pile,  assemble, link), you can use `-x' (or filename suf-
       fixes) to tell gcc where to start, and one of the  options
       `-c',  `-S',  or  `-E'  to say where gcc is to stop.  Note
       that some combinations (for example, `-x  cpp-output  -E')
       instruct gcc to do nothing at all.

       -c     Compile  or  assemble  the source files, but do not
              link.  The compiler output is an object file corre-
              sponding to each source file.

              By  default,  GCC  makes the object file name for a
              source file by replacing  the  suffix  `.c',  `.i',

GCC(1)                      GNU Tools                      GCC(1)

              `.s',  etc.,  with  `.o'.  Use -o to select another
              name.

              GCC ignores any  unrecognized  input  files  (those
              that  do  not require compilation or assembly) with
              the -c option.

       -S     Stop after the stage of compilation proper; do  not
              assemble.  The output is an assembler code file for
              each non-assembler input file specified.

              By default, GCC makes the assembler file name for a
              source  file  by  replacing  the suffix `.c', `.i',
              etc., with `.s'.  Use -o to select another name.

              GCC ignores any input files that don't require com-
              pilation.

       -E     Stop  after the preprocessing stage; do not run the
              compiler proper.  The output is preprocessed source
              code, which is sent to the standard output.

              GCC ignores input files which don't require prepro-
              cessing.

              in  `source.s',  and  all  preprocessed C source on
              standard output.

       -v     Print (on standard error output) the commands  exe-
              cuted to run the stages of compilation.  Also print
              the version number of the compiler  driver  program
              and of the preprocessor and the compiler proper.

       -pipe  Use  pipes rather than temporary files for communi-
              cation between the various stages  of  compilation.
              This fails to work on some systems where the assem-
              bler cannot read from a pipe; but the GNU assembler
              has no trouble.

LANGUAGE OPTIONS

       The  following  options  control the dialect of C that the
       compiler accepts:

       -ansi  Support all ANSI standard C programs.

              This turns off certain features of GNU C  that  are
              incompatible  with  ANSI C, such as the asm, inline
              and typeof keywords, and predefined macros such  as
              unix  and  vax that identify the type of system you
              are using.  It also  enables  the  undesirable  and
              rarely  used  ANSI  trigraph feature, and disallows
              `$' as part of identifiers.

              The  alternate  keywords  __asm__,   __extension__,
              __inline__  and __typeof__ continue to work despite
              `-ansi'.  You would not want to use them in an ANSI
              C  program, of course, but it is useful to put them
              in header files that might be included in  compila-
              tions  done  with  `-ansi'.   Alternate  predefined
              macros such as __unix__ and __vax__ are also avail-
              able, with or without `-ansi'.

              The `-ansi' option does not cause non-ANSI programs
              to be rejected gratuitously.  For that, `-pedantic'
              is required in addition to `-ansi'.

              The preprocessor predefines a macro __STRICT_ANSI__
              when you use the `-ansi' option.  Some header files
              may  notice  this  macro and refrain from declaring
              certain functions or defining certain  macros  that
              the  ANSI  standard  doesn't  call  for; this is to
              avoid interfering with any programs that might  use
              these names for other things.
              The `-ansi' option prevents alloca and  _exit  from
              being builtin functions.

       -fno-strict-prototype
              Treat  a  function  declaration  with no arguments,
              such as `int foo ();', as C would treat it--as say-

GNU Tools                   1999/01/23                          7

GCC(1)                      GNU Tools                      GCC(1)

              ing  nothing about the number of arguments or their
              types (C++ only).  Normally, such a declaration  in
              C++ means that the function foo takes no arguments.

       -trigraphs
              Support ANSI C trigraphs.  The `-ansi'  option  im-
              plies `-trigraphs'.

       -traditional
              Attempt  to  support  some aspects of traditional C
              compilers.  For details, see the GNU C Manual;  the
              duplicate  list  here  has  been deleted so that we
              won't get complaints when it is out of date.

              But one note  about  C++  programs  only  (not  C).
              `-traditional'  has  one additional effect for C++:
              assignment to this is permitted.  This is the  same
              as the effect of `-fthis-is-variable'.

       -traditional-cpp
              Attempt  to  support  some aspects of traditional C
              preprocessors.   This  includes  the   items   that
              specifically  mention  the  preprocessor above, but
              none of the other effects of `-traditional'.

       -fdollars-in-identifiers
              Permit the use of `$' in  identifiers  (C++  only).
              You  can  also use `-fno-dollars-in-identifiers' to
              explicitly prohibit use of `$'.   (GNU  C++  allows
              `$'  by default on some target systems but not oth-
              ers.)

       -fenum-int-equiv
              Permit implicit conversion of  int  to  enumeration
              types  (C++ only).  Normally GNU C++ allows conver-
              sion of enum to int, but not the other way  around.

       -fexternal-templates
              Produce  smaller code for template declarations, by
              generating only a  single  copy  of  each  template
              function  where  it  is defined (C++ only).  To use

GCC(1)                      GNU Tools                      GCC(1)

              tions are explicitly internal.

       -fall-virtual
              Treat all possible member functions as virtual, im-
              plicitly.  All member functions  (except  for  con-
              structor  functions and new or delete member opera-
              tors) are treated as virtual functions of the class
              where they appear.

              This  does  not mean that all calls to these member
              functions will be made through the  internal  table
              of  virtual  functions.   Under some circumstances,
              the compiler can determine that a call to  a  given
              virtual  function  can  be  made directly; in these
              cases the calls are direct in any case.

       -fcond-mismatch
              Allow conditional expressions with mismatched types
              in  the  second  and third arguments.  The value of
              such an expression is void.

       -fthis-is-variable
              Permit assignment to this (C++ only).  The incorpo-
              ration  of  user-defined free store management into
              C++ has made assignment to `this'  an  anachronism.
              Therefore,  by  default  it is invalid to assign to
              this within a class member function.  However,  for
              backwards compatibility, you can make it valid with
              `-fthis-is-variable'.

       -funsigned-char
              Let the type char be unsigned, like unsigned  char.

              Each  kind  of  machine has a default for what char
              should be.  It is either like unsigned char by  de-
              fault or like signed char by default.

              Ideally,  a  portable  program  should  always  use
              signed char or unsigned char when it depends on the
              signedness  of  an  object.  But many programs have
              been written to use plain char and expect it to  be
              signed,  or  expect it to be unsigned, depending on
              the machines they were written for.   This  option,
              and  its  inverse, let you make such a program work
              with the opposite default.

              The type char is always a distinct type  from  each
              of  signed  char and unsigned char, even though its

       -fsigned-bitfields

       -funsigned-bitfields

       -fno-signed-bitfields

       -fno-unsigned-bitfields
              These  options control whether a bitfield is signed
              or  unsigned,  when  declared  with   no   explicit
              `signed' or `unsigned' qualifier.  By default, such
              a bitfield is signed, because this  is  consistent:
              the  basic  integer  types  such  as int are signed
              types.

              However, when you specify `-traditional', bitfields
              are all unsigned no matter what.

       -fwritable-strings
              Store string constants in the writable data segment
              and don't uniquize them.  This is for compatibility
              with  old programs which assume they can write into
              string constants.  `-traditional' also has this ef-
              fect.

              Writing  into  string constants is a very bad idea;
              "constants" should be constant.

PREPROCESSOR OPTIONS

       These options control the C preprocessor, which is run  on
       each C source file before actual compilation.

       If  you  use the `-E' option, GCC does nothing except pre-
       processing.  Some of these options make sense only togeth-
       er with `-E' because they cause the preprocessor output to
       be unsuitable for actual compilation.

       -include file
              Process file as input before processing the regular
              input  file.   In  effect, the contents of file are
              compiled first.  Any `-D' and `-U' options  on  the
              command  line are always processed before `-include
              file', regardless of the order in  which  they  are
              written.  All the `-include' and `-imacros' options
              are processed in the order in which they are  writ-
              ten.

       -imacros file
              Process  file  as  input,  discarding the resulting
              output, before processing the regular  input  file.
              Because  the output generated from file is discard-

              Add  the  directory dir to the second include path.
              The directories on  the  second  include  path  are
              searched  when a header file is not found in any of
              the directories in the main include path  (the  one
              that `-I' adds to).

       -iprefix prefix
              Specify   prefix   as  the  prefix  for  subsequent
              `-iwithprefix' options.

       -iwithprefix dir
              Add a directory to the second  include  path.   The
              directory's  name  is  made by concatenating prefix
              and dir, where prefix was specified previously with
              `-iprefix'.

       -nostdinc
              Do  not  search the standard system directories for
              header files.  Only the directories you have speci-
              fied  with `-I' options (and the current directory,
              if appropriate) are searched.

              By using both `-nostdinc' and `-I-', you can  limit
              the include-file search file to only those directo-
              ries you specify explicitly.

       -nostdinc++
              Do not search for header files in the  C++-specific
              standard directories, but do still search the other
              standard directories.  (This option  is  used  when
              building `libg++'.)

       -undef Do  not predefine any nonstandard macros.  (Includ-
              ing architecture flags).

       -E     Run only the C preprocessor.  Preprocess all the  C
              source  files  specified  and output the results to
              standard output or to the specified output file.

       -C     Tell the  preprocessor  not  to  discard  comments.
              Used with the `-E' option.

       -P     Tell  the preprocessor not to generate `#line' com-
              mands.  Used with the `-E' option.

       -M  [ -MG ]
              Tell the preprocessor to output a rule suitable for
              make  describing  the  dependencies  of each object
              addition to `-M'.

       -MM  [ -MG ]
              Like `-M' but the output  mentions  only  the  user
              header files included with `#include "file"'.  Sys-
              tem header files included  with  `#include  <file>'
              are omitted.

       -MD    Like `-M' but the dependency information is written
              to files with names made  by  replacing  `.o'  with
              `.d'  at the end of the output file names.  This is
              in   addition   to   compiling    the    file    as
              specified--`-MD' does not inhibit ordinary compila-
              tion the way `-M' does.

              The Mach utility `md' can be used to merge the `.d'
              files  into  a  single dependency file suitable for
              using with the `make' command.

       -MMD   Like `-MD' except mention only user  header  files,
              not system header files.

       -H     Print  the  name of each header file used, in addi-
              tion to other normal activities.

       -Aquestion(answer)
              Assert the answer answer for question, in  case  it
              is  tested  with a preprocessor conditional such as
              `#if #question(answer)'.  `-A-' disables the  stan-
              dard  assertions  that normally describe the target
              machine.

       -Dmacro
              Define macro macro with the string `1' as its defi-
              nition.

       -Dmacro=defn
              Define  macro  macro  as  defn.    All instances of
              `-D' on the command line are processed  before  any
              `-U' options.
       -dN    Like `-dD' except that the macro arguments and con-
              tents are omitted.  Only `#define name' is included
              in the output.

ASSEMBLER OPTION

       -Wa,option
              Pass  option as an option to the assembler.  If op-
              tion contains commas, it is split into multiple op-
              tions at the commas.

LINKER OPTIONS

       These  options  come into play when the compiler links ob-
       ject files into an executable output file.  They are mean-
       ingless if the compiler is not doing a link step.

       object-file-name
              A  file  name that does not end in a special recog-
              nized suffix is considered to name an  object  file
              or  library.   (Object files are distinguished from
              libraries by the linker according to the file  con-
              tents.)   If  GCC  does  a  link step, these object
              files are used as input to the linker.

       -llibrary
              Use the library named library when linking.

              The linker searches a standard list of  directories
              for  the  library,  which  is actually a file named
              `liblibrary.a'.  The linker then uses this file  as
              if it had been specified precisely by name.

GNU Tools                   1999/01/23                         13

GCC(1)                      GNU Tools                      GCC(1)

              The  directories  searched include several standard
              system directories plus any that you  specify  with
              `-L'.

              Normally  the  files  found  this  way  are library
              files--archive  files  whose  members  are   object
              files.  The linker handles an archive file by scan-
              ning through it for members  which  define  symbols
              that  have  so far been referenced but not defined.
              However, if the linker  finds  an  ordinary  object
              file  rather  than  a  library,  the object file is
              linked in the usual fashion.  The  only  difference
              between  using an `-l' option and specifying a file
              name is that `-l' surrounds library with `lib'  and
              `.a' and searches several directories.

       -lobjc You  need this special case of the -l option in or-
              systems, this option has no effect.

       -shared
              Produce a shared object which can  then  be  linked
              with  other  objects to form an executable.  Only a
              few systems support this option.

       -symbolic
              Bind references to global symbols when  building  a
              shared  object.   Warn  about any unresolved refer-
              ences (unless overridden by the link editor  option
              `-Xlinker  -z  -Xlinker defs').  Only a few systems
              support this option.

       -Xlinker option
              Pass option as an option to the  linker.   You  can
              use  this  to supply system-specific linker options
              which GNU CC does not know how to recognize.

              If you want to pass an option that takes  an  argu-
              ment,  you  must use `-Xlinker' twice, once for the
              option and once for the argument.  For example,  to
              pass `-assert definitions', you must write `-Xlink-

GNU Tools                   1999/01/23                         14

GCC(1)                      GNU Tools                      GCC(1)

              er -assert -Xlinker definitions'.  It does not work
              to  write `-Xlinker "-assert definitions"', because
              this passes the entire string as a single argument,
              which is not what the linker expects.

       -Wl,option
              Pass  option as an option to the linker.  If option
              contains commas, it is split into multiple  options
              at the commas.

       -u symbol
              Pretend  the  symbol  symbol is undefined, to force
              linking of library modules to define it.   You  can
              use  `-u'  multiple times with different symbols to
              force loading of additional library modules.

DIRECTORY OPTIONS

       These options specify directories  to  search  for  header
       files, for libraries and for parts of the compiler:

       -Idir  Append  directory  dir  to  the list of directories
              searched for include files.

       -I-    Any directories you specify with `-I'  options  be-
              searching  the directory which was current when the
              compiler was invoked.  That is not exactly the same
              as what the preprocessor does by default, but it is
              often satisfactory.

              `-I-' does not inhibit the use of the standard sys-
              tem  directories for header files.  Thus, `-I-' and
              `-nostdinc' are independent.

       -Ldir  Add directory dir to the list of directories to  be
              searched for `-l'.

       -Bprefix
              This  option  specifies  where to find the executa-
              bles, libraries and data files of the compiler  it-
              self.

GCC(1)                      GNU Tools                      GCC(1)

              The compiler driver program runs one or more of the
              subprograms `cpp', `cc1' (or, for C++,  `cc1plus'),
              `as'  and  `ld'.   It  tries prefix as a prefix for
              each program it tries to run, both with and without
              `machine/version/'.

              For  each subprogram to be run, the compiler driver
              first tries the `-B' prefix, if any.  If that  name
              is  not  found,  or  if `-B' was not specified, the
              driver  tries  two  standard  prefixes,  which  are
              `/usr/lib/gcc/'  and `/usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/'.  If
              neither of those results in a  file  name  that  is
              found, the compiler driver searches for the unmodi-
              fied program name, using the directories  specified
              in your `PATH' environment variable.

              The   run-time  support  file  `libgcc.a'  is  also
              searched for using the `-B' prefix, if needed.   If
              it  is  not  found there, the two standard prefixes
              above are tried, and that is all.  The file is left
              out  of the link if it is not found by those means.
              Most of the time, on most machines,  `libgcc.a'  is
              not actually necessary.

              You  can  get a similar result from the environment
              variable GCC_EXEC_PREFIX; if  it  is  defined,  its
              value is used as a prefix in the same way.  If both
              the `-B' option and  the  GCC_EXEC_PREFIX  variable
              are  present, the `-B' option is used first and the
              environment variable value second.

       -Wno-import
              Inhibit warning messages about the use of  #import.

              Issue  all  the  warnings  demanded  by strict ANSI
              standard C; reject all programs that use  forbidden
              extensions.

              erly with or without this option (though a rare few
              will  require  `-ansi').  However, without this op-
              tion, certain GNU extensions and traditional C fea-
              tures  are  supported  as  well.  With this option,
              they are rejected.  There is no reason to use  this
              option; it exists only to satisfy pedants.

              `-pedantic' does not cause warning messages for use
              of the alternate keywords whose names begin and end
              with  `__'.  Pedantic warnings are also disabled in
              the expression that follows __extension__.   Howev-
              er,  only  system header files should use these es-
              cape  routes;  application  programs  should  avoid
              them.

       -pedantic-errors
              Like  `-pedantic',  except that errors are produced
              rather than warnings.

       -W     Print extra warning messages for these events:

          o   A nonvolatile automatic variable might  be  changed
              by  a call to longjmp.  These warnings are possible
              only in optimizing compilation.

              The compiler sees only the  calls  to  setjmp.   It
              cannot  know where longjmp will be called; in fact,
              a signal handler could call it at any point in  the
              code.  As a result, you may get a warning even when
              there is in fact no problem because longjmp  cannot
              in  fact be called at the place which would cause a
              problem.

          o   A function can return either with or without a val-
              ue.   (Falling  off the end of the function body is
              considered returning without a value.)   For  exam-
              ple, this function would evoke such a warning:

              will  cause a warning, but `x[(void)i,j]' will not.

              declared.

       -Wreturn-type
              Warn whenever a function is defined with a  return-
              type that defaults to int.  Also warn about any re-

              whose return-type is not void.

              computes a result that is explicitly not used.

       -Wswitch
              Warn whenever a switch statement has  an  index  of
              enumeral  type  and lacks a case for one or more of
              the named codes of that enumeration.  (The presence
              of  a  default  label prevents this warning.)  case
              labels outside the enumeration range  also  provoke
              warnings when this option is used.

       -Wcomment
              Warn whenever a comment-start sequence `/*' appears
              in a comment.

       -Wtrigraphs
              Warn if any  trigraphs  are  encountered  (assuming
              they are enabled).

       -Wformat
              Check calls to printf and scanf, etc., to make sure
              that the arguments supplied have types  appropriate
              to the format string specified.

       -Wchar-subscripts
              Warn  if an array subscript has type char.  This is
              a common cause of error, as programmers often  for-
              get that this type is signed on some machines.

       -Wuninitialized
              These warnings occur only for  variables  that  are
              candidates  for  register  allocation.   Therefore,
              they do not occur for a variable that  is  declared
              volatile,  or whose address is taken, or whose size
              is other than 1, 2, 4 or 8 bytes.   Also,  they  do
              not  occur  for  structures, unions or arrays, even
              when they are in registers.

              Note that there may be no warning about a  variable
              that is used only to compute a value that itself is
              never used, because such computations may be delet-
              ed  by  data  flow analysis before the warnings are
              printed.

              These warnings are made optional because GNU CC  is
              not  smart  enough  to  see all the reasons why the
              code might be correct despite appearing to have  an
              error.  Here is one example of how this can happen:

              {
                int x;
                switch (y)
                  {
                  case 1: x = 1;
                    break;
                  case 2: x = 4;
                    break;
                  case 3: x = 5;
                  }
                foo (x);
              }

              If the value of y is always 1, 2 or 3,  then  x  is
              always  initialized,  but GNU CC doesn't know this.
              Here is another common case:

              {
                int save_y;
                if (change_y) save_y = y, y = new_y;
                ...
                if (change_y) y = save_y;
              }

              This has no bug because save_y is used only  if  it
              is set.

              Some  spurious  warnings  can be avoided if you de-
              clare as volatile all the functions  you  use  that
              never return.

       -Wparentheses
              Warn  if  parentheses  are  omitted in certain con-
              avoid, even in conjunction with macros.

       The remaining `-W...' options are not implied  by  `-Wall'
       because  they  warn  about  constructions that we consider
       reasonable to use, on occasion, in clean programs.

       -Wtraditional
              Warn about certain constructs that  behave  differ-
              ently in traditional and ANSI C.

          o   Macro  arguments  occurring within string constants
              in the macro body.  These would substitute the  ar-
              gument  in  traditional C, but are part of the con-
              stant in ANSI C.

          o   A function declared external in one block and  then
              used after the end of the block.

          o   A switch statement has an operand of type long.

       -Wshadow
              Warn  whenever a local variable shadows another lo-
              cal variable.

       -Wid-clash-len
              Warn whenever two distinct identifiers match in the
              first  len characters.  This may help you prepare a
              program that will compile  with  certain  obsolete,
              brain-damaged compilers.

       -Wpointer-arith
              Warn about anything that depends on the "size of" a
              function type or of  void.   GNU  C  assigns  these
              types  a size of 1, for convenience in calculations
              with void * pointers and pointers to functions.

       -Wcast-qual
              Warn whenever a pointer is cast so as to  remove  a
              type  qualifier from the target type.  For example,
              warn if a const char * is cast to an ordinary  char
              *.

       -Wcast-align
              Warn  whenever  a pointer is cast such that the re-

              quired alignment of the target is  increased.   For
              example,  warn  if  a char * is cast to an int * on
              machines where integers can  only  be  accessed  at
              Warn  if  a prototype causes a type conversion that
              is different from what would happen to the same ar-
              gument  in  the  absence  of a prototype.  This in-
              cludes conversions of fixed point to  floating  and
              vice  versa,  and conversions changing the width or
              signedness of a fixed point  argument  except  when
              the same as the default promotion.

       -Waggregate-return
              Warn  if  any  functions  that return structures or
              unions are defined or called.  (In languages  where
              you  can return an array, this also elicits a warn-
              ing.)

       -Wstrict-prototypes
              Warn if a function is declared or  defined  without
              specifying the argument types.  (An old-style func-
              tion definition is permitted without a  warning  if
              preceded by a declaration which specifies the argu-
              ment types.)

       -Wmissing-prototypes
              Warn if a global function is defined without a pre-
              vious  prototype  declaration.  This warning is is-
              sued even if the definition itself provides a  pro-
              totype.  The aim is to detect global functions that
              fail to be declared in header files.

       -Wmissing-declarations
              Warn if a global function is defined without a pre-
              vious  declaration.   Do  so even if the definition
              itself provides a prototype.  Use  this  option  to
              detect  global  functions  that are not declared in
              header files.

       -Wredundant-decls
              Warn if anything is declared more than once in  the

              same  scope,  even in cases where multiple declara-
              tion is valid and changes nothing.

       -Wnested-externs
              Warn if an extern declaration is encountered within
              a function.

       -Wenum-clash
              Warn about conversion between different enumeration
              types (C++ only).
              Warn  if  a function can not be inlined, and either
              it was  declared  as  inline,  or  else  the  -fin-
              line-functions option was given.

       -Werror
              Treat  warnings  as errors; abort compilation after
              any warning.

DEBUGGING OPTIONS

       GNU CC has various special options that are used  for  de-
       bugging either your program or GCC:

       -g     Produce debugging information in the operating sys-
              tem's native format (stabs, COFF, XCOFF, or DWARF).
              GDB can work with this debugging information.

              On most systems that use stabs format, `-g' enables
              use of extra debugging information  that  only  GDB
              can  use;  this  extra  information makes debugging
              work better in GDB but will probably make other de-
              buggers  crash  or  refuse to read the program.  If
              you want to control for certain whether to generate
              the  extra  information, use `-gstabs+', `-gstabs',
              `-gxcoff+',  `-gxcoff',  `-gdwarf+',  or  `-gdwarf'
              (see below).

              Unlike most other C compilers, GNU CC allows you to
              use `-g' with `-O'.  The shortcuts taken  by  opti-
              mized  code may occasionally produce surprising re-
              sults: some variables you declared may not exist at

GNU Tools                   1999/01/23                         22

GCC(1)                      GNU Tools                      GCC(1)

              all; flow of control may briefly move where you did
              not expect it; some statements may not be  executed
              because they compute constant results or their val-
              ues were already at hand; some statements may  exe-
              cute  in  different  places because they were moved
              out of loops.

              Nevertheless it proves possible to debug  optimized
              output.   This makes it reasonable to use the opti-
              mizer for programs that might have bugs.

       The following options are useful when GNU CC is  generated
       with the capability for more than one debugging format.

       -ggdb  Produce  debugging information in the native format
              (if that is supported), including GDB extensions if
              at all possible.
              that is supported).  This is the format used by SDB
              on  most System V systems prior to System V Release
              4.

       -gxcoff
              Produce debugging information in XCOFF  format  (if
              that is supported).  This is the format used by the
              DBX debugger on IBM RS/6000 systems.

       -gxcoff+
              Produce debugging information in XCOFF  format  (if
              that is supported), using GNU extensions understood
              only by the GNU debugger (GDB).  The use  of  these
              extensions  is likely to make other debuggers crash
              or refuse to read the program.

       -gdwarf
              Produce debugging information in DWARF  format  (if
              that is supported).  This is the format used by SDB
              on most System V Release 4 systems.

       -gdwarf+
              Produce debugging information in DWARF  format  (if

              that is supported), using GNU extensions understood
              only by the GNU debugger (GDB).  The use  of  these
              extensions  is likely to make other debuggers crash
              or refuse to read the program.

       -glevel
       -ggdblevel
       -gstabslevel
       -gcofflevel -gxcofflevel

       -gdwarflevel
              Request debugging information and also use level to
              specify how much information.  The default level is
              2.

              Level 1 produces minimal  information,  enough  for
              making  backtraces in parts of the program that you
              don't plan to debug.  This includes descriptions of
              functions  and  external variables, but no informa-
              tion about local variables and no line numbers.

              Level 3 includes extra information, such as all the
              macro definitions present in the program.  Some de-
              buggers support macro expansion when you use `-g3'.

       -dletters
              Says  to make debugging dumps during compilation at
              times specified by letters.  This is used  for  de-
              bugging  the  compiler.  The file names for most of
              the dumps are made  by  appending  a  word  to  the
              source    file    name    (e.g.    `foo.c.rtl'   or
              `foo.c.jump').

       -dM    Dump all macro definitions, at the end  of  prepro-
              cessing, and write no output.

       -dN    Dump  all macro names, at the end of preprocessing.

       -dD    Dump all macro definitions, at the end  of  prepro-
              cessing, in addition to normal output.

GCC(1)                      GNU Tools                      GCC(1)

       -dy    Dump debugging information during parsing, to stan-
              dard error.

       -dr    Dump after RTL generation, to `file.rtl'.

       -dx    Just generate RTL for a function instead of compil-
              ing it.  Usually used with `r'.

       -dj    Dump after first jump optimization, to `file.jump'.

       -ds    Dump after CSE  (including  the  jump  optimization
              that sometimes follows CSE), to `file.cse'.

       -dL    Dump after loop optimization, to `file.loop'.

       -dt    Dump  after the second CSE pass (including the jump
              optimization  that  sometimes  follows   CSE),   to
              `file.cse2'.

       -df    Dump after flow analysis, to `file.flow'.

       -dc    Dump     after    instruction    combination,    to
              `file.combine'.

       -dS    Dump after the first instruction  scheduling  pass,
              to `file.sched'.

       -dl    Dump    after   local   register   allocation,   to
              `file.lreg'.

       -dg    Dump   after   global   register   allocation,   to

       -dm    Print statistics on memory usage, at the end of the
              run, to standard error.

       -dp    Annotate the assembler output with a comment  indi-
              cating which pattern and alternative was used.

       -fpretend-float
              When  running  a  cross-compiler,  pretend that the

GCC(1)                      GNU Tools                      GCC(1)

              target machine uses the same floating point  format
              as  the host machine.  This causes incorrect output
              of the actual floating constants,  but  the  actual
              instruction  sequence  will probably be the same as
              GNU CC would make when running on  the  target  ma-
              chine.

       -save-temps
              Store the usual "temporary" intermediate files per-
              manently; place them in the current  directory  and
              name  them based on the source file.  Thus, compil-
              ing `foo.c' with  `-c  -save-temps'  would  produce
              files `foo.cpp' and `foo.s', as well as `foo.o'.

       -print-file-name=library
              Print  the  full  absolute name of the library file
              library  that would be used  when  linking--and  do
              not  do  anything  else.   With this option, GNU CC
              does not compile or link anything; it  just  prints
              the file name.

       -print-libgcc-file-name
              Same as `-print-file-name=libgcc.a'.

       -print-prog-name=program
              Like `-print-file-name', but searches for a program
              such as `cpp'.

OPTIMIZATION OPTIONS

       These options control various sorts of optimizations:

       -O

       -O1    Optimize.  Optimizing  compilation  takes  somewhat
              more  time, and a lot more memory for a large func-
              tion.

              Without `-O', the compiler's goal is to reduce  the
              and execution time.

GNU Tools                   1999/01/23                         26

GCC(1)                      GNU Tools                      GCC(1)

              When    you   specify   `-O',   the   two   options
              `-fthread-jumps' and `-fdefer-pop' are  turned  on.
              On    machines   that   have   delay   slots,   the
              `-fdelayed-branch' option is turned on.  For  those
              machines  that can support debugging even without a
              frame pointer, the `-fomit-frame-pointer' option is
              turned  on.   On some machines other flags may also
              be turned on.

       -O2    Optimize even more.  Nearly all supported optimiza-
              tions  that  do  not involve a space-speed tradeoff
              are performed.  Loop unrolling and function  inlin-
              ing  are not done, for example.  As compared to -O,
              this option increases both compilation time and the
              performance of the generated code.

       -O3    Optimize  yet  more.  This  turns on everything -O2
              does, along with  also  turning  on  -finline-func-
              tions.

       -O0    Do not optimize.

              If  you  use  multiple  -O options, with or without
              level numbers, the last such option is the one that
              is effective.

       Options  of  the form `-fflag' specify machine-independent
       flags.  Most flags have both positive and negative  forms;
       the  negative  form  of  `-ffoo' would be `-fno-foo'.  The
       following list shows only one form--the one which  is  not
       the  default.  You can figure out the other form by either
       removing `no-' or adding it.

       -ffloat-store
              Do not store floating point variables in registers.
              This  prevents  undesirable excess precision on ma-
              chines such as the 68000 where the floating  regis-
              ters (of the 68881) keep more precision than a dou-
              ble is supposed to have.

              For most programs, the excess precision  does  only
              good,  but a few programs rely on the precise defi-
              nition of IEEE floating point.  Use `-ffloat-store'
              for such programs.

       -fmemoize-lookups
              must (1) determine  whether  the  class  implements
              member  functions  of  that name; (2) resolve which
              member function to call  (which  involves  figuring
              out  what  sorts  of  type  conversions  need to be
              made); and (3) check the visibility of  the  member
              function  to  the  caller.   All of this adds up to
              slower compilation.  Normally, the  second  time  a
              call  is made to that member function (or reference
              to that data member), it must go through  the  same
              lengthy  process  again.  This means that code like
              this

                cout << "This " << p  <<  "  has  "  <<  n  <<  "
              legs.\n";

              makes six passes through all three steps.  By using
              a software cache,  a  "hit"  significantly  reduces
              this  cost.   Unfortunately, using the cache intro-
              duces another layer of mechanisms which must be im-
              plemented,   and   so   incurs  its  own  overhead.
              `-fmemoize-lookups' enables the software cache.

              Because access privileges (visibility)  to  members
              and  member  functions may differ from one function
              context to the next, g++  may  need  to  flush  the
              cache.   With  the  `-fmemoize-lookups'  flag,  the
              cache is flushed after every function that is  com-
              piled.  The `-fsave-memoized' flag enables the same
              software cache, but when  the  compiler  determines
              that  the  context  of  the  last function compiled
              would yield the same access privileges of the  next
              function  to compile, it preserves the cache.  This
              is most helpful when defining many member functions
              for  the  same  class: with the exception of member
              functions which are friends of other classes,  each
              member  function has exactly the same access privi-
              leges as every other, and the  cache  need  not  be
              flushed.

       -fno-default-inline
              Don't make member functions inline by default mere-
              ly because they are defined inside the class  scope
              (C++ only).

       -fno-defer-pop
              Always  pop  the arguments to each function call as
              soon as that function returns.  For machines  which
              must  pop arguments after a function call, the com-
              piler normally lets  arguments  accumulate  on  the
              stack  for several function calls and pops them all
              at once.

              Force memory address constants to  be  copied  into
              registers  before  doing  arithmetic on them.  This
              may produce better code just as `-fforce-mem'  may.
              I  am  interested  in  hearing about the difference
              this makes.

       -fomit-frame-pointer
              Don't keep the frame  pointer  in  a  register  for
              functions that don't need one.  This avoids the in-
              structions to save, set up and restore frame point-
              ers;  it  also makes an extra register available in
              many functions.  It also makes debugging impossible
              on most machines.

              On some machines, such as the Vax, this flag has no
              effect, because the standard calling sequence auto-
              matically  handles the frame pointer and nothing is
              saved by pretending it doesn't exist.  The machine-
              description  macro  FRAME_POINTER_REQUIRED controls
              whether a target machine supports this flag.

       -finline-functions
              Integrate all simple functions into their  callers.
              The  compiler heuristically decides which functions
              are simple enough to be worth integrating  in  this
              way.

              If  all  calls  to a given function are integrated,
              and the function is declared static, then GCC  nor-
              mally  does  not  output  the function as assembler
              code in its own right.

       -fcaller-saves
              Enable values to be  allocated  in  registers  that
              will  be  clobbered  by function calls, by emitting
              extra instructions to save and restore  the  regis-
              ters  around  such  calls.  Such allocation is done
              only when it seems to result in  better  code  than
              would otherwise be produced.

              This  option  is  enabled by default on certain ma-
              chines, usually those which have no  call-preserved
              registers to use instead.

       -fkeep-inline-functions
              Even if all calls to a given function are integrat-
              ed, and the function is declared static,  neverthe-
              less output a separate run-time callable version of
              tions.

       -ffast-math
              This option allows GCC to violate some ANSI or IEEE
              rules/specifications  in the interest of optimizing
              code for speed.  For example, it allows the compil-
              er  to  assume  arguments  to the sqrt function are
              non-negative numbers.

              This option should never be turned on by  any  `-O'
              option  since it can result in incorrect output for
              programs which depend on an exact implementation of
              IEEE  or  ANSI  rules/specifications for math func-
              tions.

       The following options control specific optimizations.  The
       `-O2'  option  turns  on all of these optimizations except
       `-funroll-loops' and `-funroll-all-loops'.

       The `-O' option usually turns on the `-fthread-jumps'  and
       `-fdelayed-branch'  options,  but  specific  machines  may
       change the default optimizations.

       You can use the following flags in  the  rare  cases  when
       "fine-tuning" of optimizations to be performed is desired.

       -fstrength-reduce
              Perform the optimizations of loop  strength  reduc-
              tion and elimination of iteration variables.

       -fthread-jumps
              Perform  optimizations  where  we check to see if a
              jump branches to a location where another  compari-
              son  subsumed  by  the  first is found.  If so, the
              first branch is redirected to either  the  destina-
              tion  of  the  second branch or a point immediately

              following it, depending on whether the condition is
              known to be true or false.

       -funroll-loops
              Perform  the  optimization of loop unrolling.  This
              is only done for loops whose number  of  iterations
              can be determined at compile time or run time.

       -funroll-all-loops
              Perform  the  optimization of loop unrolling.  This
              is done for all loops.  This usually makes programs
              with no else clause, `-fcse-skip-blocks' causes CSE
              to follow the jump around the body of the if.

       -frerun-cse-after-loop
              Re-run common subexpression elimination after  loop
              optimizations has been performed.

       -felide-constructors
              Elide  constructors  when this seems plausible (C++
              only).  With this flag, GNU C++ initializes  y  di-
              rectly from the call to foo without going through a
              temporary in the following code:

              A foo (); A y = foo ();

              Without this option, GNU C++ first initializes y by
              calling  the  appropriate  constructor  for type A;
              then assigns the result of foo to a temporary; and,
              finally, replaces the initial value of `y' with the
              temporary.

              The default behavior (`-fno-elide-constructors') is
              specified  by the draft ANSI C++ standard.  If your
              program's constructors  have  side  effects,  using
              `-felide-constructors'  can  make  your program act
              differently, since some constructor  calls  may  be
              omitted.

       -fexpensive-optimizations
              Perform  a  number  of minor optimizations that are
              relatively expensive.

       -fdelayed-branch
              If supported for the target machine, attempt to re-
              order  instructions  to  exploit  instruction slots
              available after delayed branch instructions.

       -fschedule-insns
              If supported for the target machine, attempt to re-
              order  instructions  to  eliminate execution stalls
              due to required data being unavailable.  This helps
              machines  that  have  slow floating point or memory
              load instructions by allowing other instructions to
              be  issued until the result of the load or floating
              point instruction is required.

       -fschedule-insns2
              Similar to `-fschedule-insns', but requests an  ad-

       In addition, older and newer versions of GNU CC can be in-
       stalled side by side.  One of them (probably  the  newest)
       will be the default, but you may sometimes wish to use an-
       other.

       -b machine
              The argument machine specifies the  target  machine
              for  compilation.  This is useful when you have in-
              stalled GNU CC as a cross-compiler.

              The value to use for machine is  the  same  as  was
              specified  as the machine type when configuring GNU
              CC as a cross-compiler.  For example, if  a  cross-
              compiler  was  configured  with  `configure i386v',
              meaning to compile for an 80386 running  System  V,
              then you would specify `-b i386v' to run that cross
              compiler.

              When you do not specify `-b', it normally means  to

GCC(1)                      GNU Tools                      GCC(1)

              compile  for  the same type of machine that you are
              using.

       -V version
              The argument version specifies which version of GNU
              CC  to  run.  This is useful when multiple versions
              are  installed.   For  example,  version  might  be
              `2.0', meaning to run GNU CC version 2.0.

              The  default version, when you do not specify `-V',
              is controlled by the way GNU CC is installed.  Nor-
              mally, it will be a version that is recommended for
              general use.

MACHINE DEPENDENT OPTIONS

       Each of the target machine types can have its own  special
       options, starting with `-m', to choose among various hard-
       ware  models  or  configurations--for  example,  68010  vs
       68020,  floating  coprocessor or none.  A single installed
       version of the compiler can compile for any model or  con-
       figuration, according to the options specified.

       Some configurations of the compiler also support addition-
       al special options, usually for command-line compatibility
       with other compilers on the same platform.

       These are the `-m' options defined for the 68000 series:

       -m68881
              Generate  output  containing 68881 instructions for
              floating point.   This  is  the  default  for  most
              68020-based  systems unless -nfp was specified when
              the compiler was configured.

       -m68030
              Generate output for a 68030.  This is  the  default
              when  the  compiler  is  configured for 68030-based
              systems.

GCC(1)                      GNU Tools                      GCC(1)

       -m68040
              Generate output for a 68040.  This is  the  default
              when  the  compiler  is  configured for 68040-based
              systems.

       -m68020-40
              Generate output for a 68040, without using  any  of
              the  new  instructions.  This results in code which
              can  run  relatively  efficiently   on   either   a
              68020/68881 or a 68030 or a 68040.

       -mfpa  Generate output containing Sun FPA instructions for
              floating point.

       -msoft-float
              Generate output containing library calls for float-
              ing  point.   WARNING:  the requisite libraries are
              not part of GNU CC.  Normally the facilities of the
              machine's usual C compiler are used, but this can't
              be done directly in  cross-compilation.   You  must
              make  your own arrangements to provide suitable li-
              brary functions for cross-compilation.

       -mshort
              Consider type int to be 16 bits  wide,  like  short
              int.

       -mnobitfield
              Do  not  use the bit-field instructions.  `-m68000'
              implies `-mnobitfield'.

       -mbitfield
              Do use the bit-field instructions.   `-m68020'  im-
              plies `-mbitfield'.  This is the default if you use
              the unmodified sources.

              (including printf); otherwise incorrect  code  will
              be generated for calls to those functions.

              if you call a function  with  too  many  arguments.
              (Normally, extra arguments are harmlessly ignored.)

              The rtd instruction is supported by the  68010  and
              68020 processors, but not by the 68000.

       These `-m' options are defined for the Vax:

       -munix Do not output certain jump instructions (aobleq and
              so on) that the Unix assembler for the  Vax  cannot
              handle across long ranges.

       -mgnu  Do  output  those jump instructions, on the assump-
              tion that you will assemble with the GNU assembler.

       -mg    Output code for g-format floating point numbers in-
              stead of d-format.

       These `-m' switches are supported on the SPARC:

       -mfpu

       -mhard-float
              Generate output containing floating point  instruc-
              tions.  This is the default.

       -mno-fpu

       -msoft-float
              Generate output containing library calls for float-
              ing point.  Warning: there is no GNU floating-point
              library  for SPARC.  Normally the facilities of the
              machine's usual C compiler are used, but this  can-
              not  be  done  directly  in cross-compilation.  You
              must make your own arrangements to provide suitable
              library functions for cross-compilation.

              -msoft-float  changes the calling convention in the
              output file; therefore, it is only  useful  if  you
              compile all of a program with this option.

       -mno-epilogue

       -mno-v8

       -mv8

       -msparclite
              These  three options select variations on the SPARC
              architecture.

              By default (unless specifically configured for  the
              Fujitsu  SPARClite),  GCC generates code for the v7
              variant of the SPARC architecture.

              -mv8 will give you SPARC v8 code.  The only differ-
              ence  from  v7  code is that the compiler emits the
              integer multiply and  integer  divide  instructions
              which exist in SPARC v8 but not in SPARC v7.

              -msparclite  will  give  you  SPARClite code.  This
              adds the integer multiply, integer divide step  and
              scan  (ffs)  instructions  which exist in SPARClite
              but not in SPARC v7.

       -mcypress

       -msupersparc
              These two options select the  processor  for  which
              the code is optimized.

              With  -mcypress  (the  default), the compiler opti-
              mizes code for the Cypress CY7C602 chip, as used in
              the  SparcStation/SparcServer  3xx  series. This is
              also appropriate for the older SparcStation  1,  2,
              IPX etc.

              With  -msupersparc  the compiler optimizes code for
              the SuperSparc cpu, as used in the SparcStation 10,
              1000 and 2000 series. This flag also enables use of
              the full SPARC v8 instruction set.

       These `-m' options are defined for the Convex:

       -mc1   Generate output for a C1.  This is the default when
              the compiler is configured for a C1.

       -mc2   Generate output for a C2.  This is the default when
              the compiler is configured for a C2.

       -margcount
              Generate code which puts an argument count  in  the
              word  preceding  each  argument  list.   Some  non-
              portable Convex and Vax programs  need  this  word.
       -mdw   Generate code that assumes the DW bit is set, i.e.,
              that byte and halfword operations are directly sup-
              ported by the hardware.  This is the default.

       -mnodw Generate code that assumes the DW bit is not set.

       -mbw   Generate code that assumes the system supports byte
              and  halfword  write  operations.   This is the de-
              fault.

       -mnbw  Generate code that assumes  the  systems  does  not
              support  byte  and halfword write operations.  This
              implies `-mnodw'.

       -msmall
              Use a small memory  model  that  assumes  that  all
              function  addresses  are either within a single 256
              KB segment or at an absolute address of  less  than
              256K.   This allows the call instruction to be used
              instead of a const, consth, calli sequence.

       -mlarge
              Do not assume that  the  call  instruction  can  be
              used; this is the default.

       -m29050
              Generate code for the Am29050.

       -m29000
              Generate  code  for  the  Am29000.  This is the de-
              fault.

       -mkernel-registers
              Generate references to registers gr64-gr95  instead
              of  gr96-gr127.   This option can be used when com-
              piling kernel code that wants a set of global  reg-
              isters disjoint from that used by user-mode code.

              Note  that when this option is used, register names
              in `-f'  flags  must  use  the  normal,  user-mode,
              names.

       -muser-registers
              Use the normal set of global registers, gr96-gr127.
              This is the default.

       -mstack-check
              Insert a call to __msp_check after each  stack  ad-

       -m88110
              Generate code that works best for the  m88110,  and
              may not run on the m88100.

       -midentify-revision
              Include  an ident directive in the assembler output
              recording the source file name, compiler  name  and
              version, timestamp, and compilation flags used.

       -mno-underscores
              In  assembler  output,  emit  symbol  names without
              adding an underscore character at the beginning  of
              each  name.  The default is to use an underscore as
              prefix on each name.

       -mno-check-zero-division

       -mcheck-zero-division
              Early models of the 88K architecture  had  problems
              with  division by zero; in particular, many of them
              didn't trap.  Use these options to avoid  including
              (or  to  include explicitly) additional code to de-
              tect division by zero and signal an exception.  All
              GCC     configurations     for    the    88K    use
              `-mcheck-zero-division' by default.

       -mocs-debug-info

       -mno-ocs-debug-info
              Include (or omit) additional debugging  information
              (about registers used in each stack frame) as spec-
              ified in the 88Open Object Compatibility  Standard,
              "OCS".   This  extra  information  is not needed by
              GDB.  The default for DG/UX,  SVr4,  and  Delta  88
              SVr3.2  is  to  include this information; other 88k
              configurations omit this information by default.

              stored  in  a  particular place in stack frames, as
              specified in OCS.  The DG/UX, Delta88  SVr3.2,  and
              BCS configurations use `-mocs-frame-position'; oth-
              er   88k   configurations    have    the    default
              `-mno-ocs-frame-position'.

              You  control  which data references are affected by
              specifying num with this option.  For  example,  if
              you  specify `-mshort-data-512', then the data ref-
              erences affected are those involving  displacements
              of  less than 512 bytes.  `-mshort-data-num' is not
              effective for num greater than 64K.

       -mserialize-volatile

       -mno-serialize-volatile
              Do, or do not, generate code to  guarantee  sequen-
              tial consistency of volatile memory references.

              GNU  CC  always  guarantees consistency by default,
              for the preferred processor submodel.  How this  is
              done depends on the submodel.

              The m88100 processor does not reorder memory refer-
              ences and so always provides sequential  consisten-
              cy.  If you use `-m88100', GNU CC does not generate
              any special instructions for sequential  consisten-
              cy.

              The  order  of memory references made by the m88110
              processor does not always match the  order  of  the
              instructions  requesting those references.  In par-
              ticular, a load instruction may  execute  before  a
              preceding  store instruction.  Such reordering vio-
              lates sequential  consistency  of  volatile  memory
              references,  when  there  are  multiple processors.
              When you use `-m88000' or `-m88110', GNU CC  gener-
              ates  special  instructions  when  appropriate,  to
              force execution in the proper order.

              The extra code generated to  guarantee  consistency
              may affect the performance of your application.  If
              you know that you can safely forgo this  guarantee,
              you may use the option `-mno-serialize-volatile'.

              If you use the `-m88100' option but require sequen-
              tial consistency when running on the m88110 proces-
              sor, you should use `-mserialize-volatile'.

       -msvr4

       -msvr3 Turn  on  (`-msvr4') or off (`-msvr3') compiler ex-
              tensions related to  System  V  release  4  (SVr4).
              This controls the following:
       -mtrap-large-shift

       -mhandle-large-shift
              Include code to detect bit-shifts of more  than  31
              bits;  respectively,  trap such shifts or emit code
              to handle them properly.  By default GCC  makes  no
              special provision for large bit shifts.

       -muse-div-instruction
              Very  early  models  of the 88K architecture didn't
              have a divide instruction, so GCC avoids  that  in-
              struction  by  default.  Use this option to specify
              that it's safe to use the divide instruction.

       -mversion-03.00
              In the DG/UX configuration, there are  two  flavors
              of  SVr4.   This  option  modifies -msvr4 to select
              whether the hybrid-COFF or real-ELF flavor is used.
              All other configurations ignore this option.

       -mwarn-passed-structs
              Warn when a function passes a struct as an argument
              or  result.   Structure-passing  conventions   have
              changed during the evolution of the C language, and
              are often the source of portability  problems.   By
              default, GCC issues no such warning.

       These options are defined for the IBM RS6000:

       -mfp-in-toc

       -mno-fp-in-toc
              Control  whether or not floating-point constants go
              in the Table of Contents  (TOC),  a  table  of  all
              global variable and function addresses.  By default
              GCC puts floating-point constants there; if the TOC
              overflows, `-mno-fp-in-toc' will reduce the size of
              the TOC, which may avoid the overflow.

       These `-m' options are defined for the IBM RT PC:

       -min-line-mul
              Use an in-line code  sequence  for  integer  multi-
              plies.  This is the default.

       -mcall-lib-mul
              Call lmul$$ for integer multiples.

              ments are passed in floating point registers.  Note
              that  varargs.h  and  stdargs.h  will not work with
              floating point operands if this  option  is  speci-
              fied.

       -mfp-arg-in-gregs
              Use  the  normal  calling  convention  for floating
              point arguments.  This is the default.

       -mhc-struct-return
              Return structures of more than one word in  memory,
              rather  than in a register.  This provides compati-
              bility with the MetaWare HighC (hc) compiler.   Use
              `-fpcc-struct-return'  for  compatibility  with the
              Portable C Compiler (pcc).

       -mnohc-struct-return
              Return some structures of more  than  one  word  in
              registers,  when  convenient.  This is the default.

              For compatibility with the IBM-supplied  compilers,
              use       either      `-fpcc-struct-return'      or
              `-mhc-struct-return'.

       These `-m' options are defined for the MIPS family of com-
       puters:

       -mcpu=cpu-type
              Assume  the  defaults for the machine type cpu-type
              when scheduling instructions.  The default cpu-type
              is  default,  which  picks the longest cycles times
              for any of the machines, in order that the code run
              at  reasonable  rates  on  all  MIPS  cpu's.  Other
              choices for cpu-type are r2000, r3000,  r4000,  and
              r6000.   While  picking  a  specific  cpu-type will
              schedule things appropriately for  that  particular
              chip,  the compiler will not generate any code that
              does not meet level 1 of the MIPS ISA  (instruction
              set  architecture)  without  the  -mips2  or -mips3
              switches being used.

       -mips2 Issue instructions from level 2  of  the  MIPS  ISA
              (branch  likely,  square  root  instructions).  The
              -mcpu=r4000 or -mcpu=r6000 switch must be  used  in
              conjunction with -mips2.

       -mips3 Issue instructions from level 3 of the MIPS ISA (64
              bit instructions).  The -mcpu=r4000 switch must  be
              format.   If any of the -ggdb, -gstabs, or -gstabs+
              switches are used, the mips-tfile program will  en-
              capsulate the stabs within MIPS ECOFF.

       -mgas  Generate  code  for the GNU assembler.  This is the
              default on the OSF/1 reference platform, using  the
              OSF/rose object format.

       -mrnames

       -mno-rnames
              The  -mrnames  switch says to output code using the

GCC(1)                      GNU Tools                      GCC(1)

              MIPS software names for the registers,  instead  of
              the hardware names (ie, a0 instead of $4).  The GNU
              assembler does not support the -mrnames switch, and
              the  MIPS  assembler  will be instructed to run the
              MIPS C preprocessor  over  the  source  file.   The
              -mno-rnames switch is default.

       -mgpopt

       -mno-gpopt
              The  -mgpopt  switch  says to write all of the data
              declarations before the instructions  in  the  text
              section,  to all the MIPS assembler to generate one
              word memory references instead of using  two  words
              for  short global or static data items.  This is on
              by default if optimization is selected.

       -mstats

       -mno-stats
              For each non-inline function processed, the -mstats
              switch  causes the compiler to emit one line to the
              standard error file to print statistics  about  the
              program  (number  of  registers  saved, stack size,
              etc.).

       -mmemcpy

       -mno-memcpy
              The -mmemcpy switch makes all block moves call  the
              appropriate  string  function (memcpy or bcopy) in-
              stead of possibly generating inline code.

       -mmips-tfile

              not part of GNU CC.  Normally the facilities of the
              machine's usual C compiler are used, but this can't
              be done directly in  cross-compilation.   You  must
              make  your own arrangements to provide suitable li-
              brary functions for cross-compilation.

       -mhard-float
              Generate output containing floating point  instruc-
              tions.   This is the default if you use the unmodi-
              fied sources.

       -mfp64 Assume that the FR bit in the status  word  is  on,
              and  that there are 32 64-bit floating point regis-
              ters, instead of 32 32-bit  floating  point  regis-
              ters.   You  must  also specify the -mcpu=r4000 and
              -mips3 switches.

       -mfp32 Assume that there are 32 32-bit floating point reg-
              isters.  This is the default.

       -mabicalls

       -mno-abicalls
              Emit  (or  do not emit) the .abicalls, .cpload, and
              .cprestore pseudo operations that some  System  V.4
              ports use for position independent code.

       -mhalf-pic

       -mno-half-pic
              The  -mhalf-pic  switch says to put pointers to ex-
              tern references into the data section and load them
              up, rather than put the references in the text sec-
              tion.  This option does not work at present.  -Gnum
              Put  global  and static items less than or equal to
              num bytes into the small data or bss  sections  in-
              stead  of the normal data or bss section.  This al-
              lows the assembler to emit one word  memory  refer-
              ence  instructions  based on the global pointer (gp
              or $28), instead of the normal two words used.   By
              default,  num is 8 when the MIPS assembler is used,
              and 0 when the GNU assembler is  used.   The  -Gnum
              switch  is also passed to the assembler and linker.
              All modules should be compiled with the same  -Gnum
              value.

       -nocpp Tell the MIPS assembler to not run its preprocessor
              over user assembler files (with a `.s' suffix) when

              ing  point.   Warning:  the requisite libraries are
              not part of GNU CC.  Normally the facilities of the
              machine's usual C compiler are used, but this can't
              be done directly in  cross-compilation.   You  must
              make  your own arrangements to provide suitable li-
              brary functions for cross-compilation.

              On machines where a function returns floating point
              results  in the 80387 register stack, some floating
              point opcodes may be emitted even if `-msoft-float'
              is used.

       -mno-fp-ret-in-387
              Do  not  use the FPU registers for return values of
              functions.

              The usual calling convention has  functions  return
              values  of  types float and double in an FPU regis-
              ter, even if there is no FPU.  The idea is that the
              operating system should emulate an FPU.

              The  option `-mno-fp-ret-in-387' causes such values
              to be returned in ordinary CPU registers instead.

       -mprofiler-epilogue

       -mno-profiler-epilogue
              Generate extra code to  write  profile  information
              for function exits.

       These `-m' options are defined for the HPPA family of com-
       puters:

       -mpa-risc-1-0
              Generate code for a PA 1.0 processor.

       -mpa-risc-1-1
              Generate code for a PA 1.1 processor.

       -mkernel
              Generate code which is suitable for use in kernels.
              Specifically,  avoid  add instructions in which one
              of the arguments is the DP register; generate addil
              instructions instead.  This avoids a rather serious
              bug in the HP-UX linker.

       -mshared-libs
              Generate code that  can  be  linked  against  HP-UX
       -mlong-calls
              Generate  code  which  allows  calls  to  functions
              greater  than  256K  away  from the caller when the
              caller and callee are in the same source file.   Do
              not turn this option on unless code refuses to link
              with "branch out of range errors from the linker.

       -mdisable-fpregs
              Prevent floating point registers from being used in
              any  manner.   This is necessary for compiling ker-
              nels which perform lazy context switching of float-
              ing  point  registers.   If you use this option and
              attempt to perform floating point  operations,  the
              compiler will abort.

       -mdisable-indexing
              Prevent  the  compiler  from using indexing address
              modes.  This avoids some  rather  obscure  problems
              when compiling MIG generated code under MACH.

       -mtrailing-colon
              Add  a  colon  to the end of label definitions (for
              ELF assemblers).

       These `-m' options are defined for the Intel 80960  family
       of computers:

       -mcpu-type
              Assume  the  defaults for the machine type cpu-type
              for instruction  and  addressing-mode  availability
              and  alignment.   The default cpu-type is kb; other
              choices are ka, mc, ca, cf, sa, and sb.

       -mnumerics

       -msoft-float
              The -mnumerics option indicates that the  processor
              does   support  floating-point  instructions.   The
              -msoft-float option indicates  that  floating-point
              support should not be assumed.

       -mleaf-procedures

       -mno-leaf-procedures
              Do  (or do not) attempt to alter leaf procedures to
              be callable with the bal  instruction  as  well  as
              call.   This will result in more efficient code for
              explicit calls when the bal instruction can be sub-
              stituted by the assembler or linker, but less effi-

GNU Tools                   1999/01/23                         46

              totally complete.  The default is -mno-tail-call.

       -mcomplex-addr

       -mno-complex-addr
              Assume (or do not assume) that the use of a complex
              addressing mode is a win on this implementation  of
              the  i960.   Complex  addressing  modes  may not be
              worthwhile on the K-series, but they definitely are
              on  the  C-series.  The default is currently -mcom-
              plex-addr for all processors except the CB and  CC.

       -mcode-align

       -mno-code-align
              Align code to 8-byte boundaries for faster fetching
              (or don't bother).  Currently turned on by  default
              for C-series implementations only.

       -mic-compat

       -mic2.0-compat

       -mic3.0-compat
              Enable compatibility with iC960 v2.0 or v3.0.

       -masm-compat

       -mintel-asm
              Enable compatibility with the iC960 assembler.

       -mstrict-align

       -mno-strict-align
              Do not permit (do permit) unaligned accesses.

       -mold-align
              Enable  structure-alignment  compatibility with In-
              tel's gcc release version 1.3 (based on gcc  1.37).
              Currently  this is buggy in that #pragma align 1 is
              always assumed as well, and cannot be turned off.

GCC(1)                      GNU Tools                      GCC(1)

       These `-m' options are defined for the DEC Alpha implemen-
       tations:

       -mno-soft-float

       -msoft-float
              point registers.

       -mfp-reg

       -mno-fp-regs
              Generate  code  that uses (does not use) the float-
              ing-point  register  set.    -mno-fp-regs   implies
              -msoft-float.   If  the floating-point register set
              is not used, floating point operands are passed  in
              integer  registers  as  if  they  were integers and
              floating-point results are passed in $0 instead  of
              $f0.   This  is a non-standard calling sequence, so
              any function with a floating-point argument or  re-
              turn  value  called  by code compiled with -mno-fp-
              regs must also be compiled with that option.

              A typical use of this option is building  a  kernel
              that  does not use, and hence need not save and re-
              store, any floating-point registers.

       These additional options are available on System V Release
       4 for compatibility with other compilers on those systems:

       -G     On SVr4 systems, gcc accepts the option  `-G'  (and
              passes  it to the system linker), for compatibility
              with other compilers.  However, we suggest you  use
              `-symbolic' or `-shared' as appropriate, instead of
              supplying linker options on the gcc command line.

       -Qy    Identify the versions of each tool used by the com-
              piler,  in a .ident assembler directive in the out-
              put.

              file (this is the default).

       -YP,dirs
              Search the directories dirs, and no others, for li-
              braries specified with `-l'.  You can separate  di-
              rectory  entries  in  dirs  from  one  another with
              colons.

       -Ym,dir
              Look in the directory dir to find the M4 preproces-
              sor.  The assembler uses this option.

CODE GENERATION OPTIONS

              Normally, GNU C++  makes  conservative  assumptions
              about  objects reached through references.  For ex-
              ample, the compiler must check that a is  not  null
              in code like the following:

              obj &a = g (); a.f (2);

              Checking that references of this sort have non-null
              values requires extra code, however, and it is  un-
              necessary   for   many   programs.    You  can  use
              `-fnonnull-objects' to omit the checks for null, if
              your program doesn't require checking.

       -fpcc-struct-return
              Use  the  same  convention for returning struct and
              union values that is used by the usual  C  compiler
              on  your system.  This convention is less efficient
              for small structures, and on many machines it fails
              to be reentrant; but it has the advantage of allow-
              ing intercallability between GCC-compiled code  and
              PCC-compiled code.

       -freg-struct-return
              Use the convention that struct and union values are
              returned in registers when possible.  This is  more
              efficient     for     small     structures     than
              -fpcc-struct-return.

              If  you  specify  neither  -fpcc-struct-return  nor
              -freg-struct-return,  GNU  CC defaults to whichever
              convention is standard for the target.  If there is
              no   standard   convention,   GNU  CC  defaults  to
              -fpcc-struct-return.

       -fshort-enums
              Allocate to an enum type only as many bytes  as  it
              needs  for  the  declared range of possible values.
              Specifically, the enum type will be  equivalent  to
              the smallest integer type which has enough room.

       -fshort-double
              Use the same size for double as for float .

       -fshared-data
              Requests  that  the data and non-const variables of
              this compilation be shared data rather than private
              data.   The distinction makes sense only on certain
              operating systems, where shared data is shared  be-
       -fno-ident
              Ignore the `#ident' directive.

       -fno-gnu-linker
              Do not output global initializations (such  as  C++
              constructors  and  destructors) in the form used by
              the GNU linker (on systems where the GNU linker  is
              the  standard  method  of handling them).  Use this
              option when you want to use a non-GNU linker, which
              also  requires  using  the collect2 program to make
              sure the system linker  includes  constructors  and
              destructors.   (collect2  is included in the GNU CC
              distribution.)  For systems  which  must  use  col-
              lect2,  the compiler driver gcc is configured to do
              this automatically.

       -finhibit-size-directive
              Don't output a .size assembler directive,  or  any-
              thing else that would cause trouble if the function
              is split in the middle,  and  the  two  halves  are

              placed  at locations far apart in memory.  This op-
              tion  is  used  when  compiling  `crtstuff.c';  you
              should not need to use it for anything else.

       -fverbose-asm
              Put  extra  commentary information in the generated
              assembly code to make it more readable.   This  op-
              tion is generally only of use to those who actually
              need to read the generated assembly  code  (perhaps
              while debugging the compiler itself).

       -fvolatile
              Consider  all memory references through pointers to
              be volatile.

       -fvolatile-global
              Consider all memory references to extern and global
              data items to be volatile.

       -fpic  If  supported for the target machines, generate po-
              sition-independent code,  suitable  for  use  in  a
              shared library.

       -fPIC  If supported for the target machine, emit position-
              independent code,  suitable  for  dynamic  linking,
              even if branches need large displacements.

       -fcall-used-reg
              Treat the register named reg as an allocatable reg-
              ister  that is clobbered by function calls.  It may
              be allocated for temporaries or variables  that  do
              not  live  across  a call.  Functions compiled this
              way will not save and restore the register reg.

              Use of this flag for a register that  has  a  fixed
              pervasive  role  in  the machine's execution model,
              such as the stack pointer or  frame  pointer,  will
              produce disastrous results.

              This flag does not have a negative form, because it

              specifies a three-way choice.

       -fcall-saved-reg
              Treat the register named reg as an allocatable reg-
              ister saved by functions.  It may be allocated even
              for temporaries or variables  that  live  across  a
              call.   Functions  compiled  this way will save and
              restore the register reg if they use it.

              Use of this flag for a register that  has  a  fixed
              pervasive  role  in  the machine's execution model,
              such as the stack pointer or  frame  pointer,  will
              produce disastrous results.

              A  different  sort of disaster will result from the
              use of this flag for a register in  which  function
              values may be returned.

              This flag does not have a negative form, because it
              specifies a three-way choice.

PRAGMAS

       Two `#pragma' directives are supported  for  GNU  C++,  to
       permit  using  the same header file for two purposes: as a
       definition of interfaces to a given object class,  and  as
       the  full definition of the contents of that object class.

       #pragma interface
              (C++ only.)  Use this  directive  in  header  files
              that  define  object classes, to save space in most
              of the object files that use those  classes.   Nor-
              mally,  local copies of certain information (backup
              copies of inline member functions, debugging infor-
              mation, and the internal tables that implement vir-
              when  you  want  full  output  from included header
              files to be generated (and made globally  visible).
              The  included  header  file,  in  turn,  should use
              `#pragma interface'.  Backup copies of inline  mem-
              ber  functions,  debugging information, and the in-
              ternal tables used to implement  virtual  functions

GCC(1)                      GNU Tools                      GCC(1)

              are all generated in implementation files.

              If  you  use `#pragma implementation' with no argu-
              ment, it applies to an include file with  the  same
              basename  as  your  source  file;  for  example, in
              `allclass.cc', `#pragma implementation'  by  itself
              is    equivalent    to    `#pragma   implementation
              "allclass.h"'.  Use the string argument if you want
              a  single  implementation file to include code from
              multiple header files.

              There is no way to split up the contents of a  sin-
              gle header file into multiple implementation files.
