What is a Computer?
You have probably use a computer for work or fun - playing games, 
surfing on the Internet, etc.
-- Computers can handle repetitive chores without becoming bored or exhausted.
The compuer itself is a machine that stores data (numbers, words, pictures),
interacts with devices (the monitor, the keyboard, the sound system), and
executes programs.  Programs are sequences of instructions and decisions
that the computer can carries out to achieve a task. 
-- A computer is programmable to handle different tasks:
    * Balancing checkbooks
    * Processing words
    * Playing Games
Programs are composed of extremely primitive operations.
 0 Put a red dot at this position;
 0 send a letter A to the printer;
 0 get a number from this location in memory;
 0 add these 2 numbers;
 0 if this value is negative, continue the program at that instruction.
-- Computer actions are composed of huge numbers of extremely primitive operations
-- The computer gives the illusion of smooth interaction because it executes these operations a great speed.
-- Computers are flexible: they can handle a wide range of tasks.

What is Programming?
-- A program tells the computer the sequence of steps needed to fulfill a task.
-- A programmer designs and implements these programs.
To use a computer you do not need to do any programming.  
-- Most computer users are not computer programmers.
Word processing, drawing pictures, multimedia creating, data searching, etc.
-- Programming is an essential skill for a computer scientist.
-- Programming is not the only skill required to be a successful computer scientist.
-- Early programming experiences are mundane and will not rival sophisticated software that you are familiar with.
-- Once certain skills are developed, even simple programs can be thrilling.
In fact, the computer become an extension of your mental powers.

The Anatomy of a Computer (CPU, Memory, and bus)
To understand the programming process, you need to have a rudimentary (basic) understanding
of the building blocks that make up a computer. We will look at  a personal computer.
Large computers have fundamentaly the same design.
The heart of the computer ...
    * CPU (Central Processing Unit): (cosists of a single chip)
          o Plastic, metal and mostly silicon.
          o Composed of several million transistors.(Pentium)
          o Enormously complicated wiring.
          o Performs program control, arithmetic, and data movement.
          o Locates and executes program instructions.
[technical characteristics: speed, producer, cach, ets]
    * Memory:
          o RAM (Random Access Memory): read-write memory.
          o ROM (Read Only Memory): contains certain programs that must always be present.
          o Secondary storage (e.g. a hard drive) provides persistent storage.
[measurement of data - bit, byte, KB, MB, GB, TB]

    * The bus is a set of electrical lines that connect the CPU, RAM, and other devices.
