SYNOPSIS

       gcc [ option | filename ]...
       g++ [ option | filename ]...

WARNING

       The  information  in  this man page is an extract from the
       full documentation of the GNU C compiler, and  is  limited
       to the meaning of the options.

       This  man  page  is not kept up to date except when volun-
       teers want to maintain it.   If  you  find  a  discrepancy
       between  the  man  page and the software, please check the
       Info file, which is the authoritative documentation.

       If we find that the things in this man page that  are  out
       of date cause significant confusion or complaints, we will
       stop distributing the man page.  The alternative, updating
       the  man  page when we update the Info file, is impossible
       because the rest of the work of maintaining GNU CC  leaves
       us no time for that.  The GNU project regards man pages as
       obsolete and should not let them take time away from other
       things.

       For  complete and current documentation, refer to the Info
       file `gcc' or the manual Using and  Porting  GNU  CC  (for
       version  2.0).  Both are made from the Texinfo source file
       gcc.texinfo.

DESCRIPTION

       The C and C++  compilers  are  integrated.   Both  process
       input  files  through  one or more of four stages: prepro-
       cessing, compilation, assembly, and linking.  Source file-
       name suffixes identify the source language, but which name
       you use for the compiler governs default assumptions:

       gcc    assumes preprocessed (.i) files are C and assumes C
              style linking.

       g++    assumes preprocessed (.i) files are C++ and assumes
              C++ style linking.

       Suffixes of source file names indicate  the  language  and
       kind of processing to be done:

       .c    C source; preprocess, compile, assemble
       .C    C++ source; preprocess, compile, assemble
       .cc   C++ source; preprocess, compile, assemble
       .cxx  C++ source; preprocess, compile, assemble
       .m    Objective-C source; preprocess, compile, assemble
       .i    preprocessed C; compile, assemble
       .ii   preprocessed C++; compile, assemble

       Linking is always the last stage unless you use one of the
       -c,  -S,  or -E options to avoid it (or unless compilation
       errors stop the whole process).  For the link  stage,  all
       .o  files  corresponding  to  source  files, -l libraries,
       unrecognized filenames (including named  .o  object  files
       and  .a archives) are passed to the linker in command-line
       order.

OPTIONS

       Options must be separate: `-dr' is  quite  different  from
       `-d -r '.

       Most `-f' and `-W' options have two contrary forms: -fname
       and -fno-name (or -Wname and -Wno-name).   Only  the  non-
       default forms are shown here.

       Here  is  a  summary  of all the options, grouped by type.
       Explanations are in the following sections.

FreeBSD SPECIFIC OPTIONS

       -pthread
              Link a user-threaded process against libc_r instead
              of libc. Objects linked into user-threaded process-
              es should be compiled with -D_THREAD_SAFE.
              `objective-c',  `c-header',  `c++',   `cpp-output',
              `assembler', and `assembler-with-cpp'.

       -x none
              Turn  off  any specification of a language, so that
              subsequent files are  handled  according  to  their
              file  name  suffixes  (as  they are if `-x' has not
              been used at all).

       If you want only some of the four stages (preprocess, com-
       pile,  assemble, link), you can use `-x' (or filename suf-
       fixes) to tell gcc where to start, and one of the  options
       `-c',  `-S',  or  `-E'  to say where gcc is to stop.  Note
       that some combinations (for example, `-x  cpp-output  -E')
       instruct gcc to do nothing at all.

       -c     Compile  or  assemble  the source files, but do not
              link.  The compiler output is an object file corre-
              sponding to each source file.

              By  default,  GCC  makes the object file name for a
              source file by replacing  the  suffix  `.c',  `.i',

GCC(1)                      GNU Tools                      GCC(1)

              `.s',  etc.,  with  `.o'.  Use -o to select another
              name.

              GCC ignores any  unrecognized  input  files  (those
              that  do  not require compilation or assembly) with
              the -c option.

       -S     Stop after the stage of compilation proper; do  not
              assemble.  The output is an assembler code file for
              each non-assembler input file specified.

              By default, GCC makes the assembler file name for a
              source  file  by  replacing  the suffix `.c', `.i',
              etc., with `.s'.  Use -o to select another name.

              GCC ignores any input files that don't require com-
              pilation.

       -E     Stop  after the preprocessing stage; do not run the
              compiler proper.  The output is preprocessed source
              code, which is sent to the standard output.

              GCC ignores input files which don't require prepro-
              cessing.

              in  `source.s',  and  all  preprocessed C source on
              standard output.

       -v     Print (on standard error output) the commands  exe-
              cuted to run the stages of compilation.  Also print
              the version number of the compiler  driver  program
              and of the preprocessor and the compiler proper.

       -pipe  Use  pipes rather than temporary files for communi-
              cation between the various stages  of  compilation.
              This fails to work on some systems where the assem-
              bler cannot read from a pipe; but the GNU assembler
              has no trouble.

LANGUAGE OPTIONS

       The  following  options  control the dialect of C that the
       compiler accepts:

       -ansi  Support all ANSI standard C programs.

              This turns off certain features of GNU C  that  are
              incompatible  with  ANSI C, such as the asm, inline
              and typeof keywords, and predefined macros such  as
              unix  and  vax that identify the type of system you
              are using.  It also  enables  the  undesirable  and
              rarely  used  ANSI  trigraph feature, and disallows
              `$' as part of identifiers.

              The  alternate  keywords  __asm__,   __extension__,
              __inline__  and __typeof__ continue to work despite
              `-ansi'.  You would not want to use them in an ANSI
              C  program, of course, but it is useful to put them
              in header files that might be included in  compila-
              tions  done  with  `-ansi'.   Alternate  predefined
              macros such as __unix__ and __vax__ are also avail-
              able, with or without `-ansi'.

              The `-ansi' option does not cause non-ANSI programs
              to be rejected gratuitously.  For that, `-pedantic'
              is required in addition to `-ansi'.

              The preprocessor predefines a macro __STRICT_ANSI__
              when you use the `-ansi' option.  Some header files
              may  notice  this  macro and refrain from declaring
              certain functions or defining certain  macros  that
              the  ANSI  standard  doesn't  call  for; this is to
              avoid interfering with any programs that might  use
              these names for other things.
              The `-ansi' option prevents alloca and  _exit  from
              being builtin functions.

       -fno-strict-prototype
              Treat  a  function  declaration  with no arguments,
              such as `int foo ();', as C would treat it--as say-

GNU Tools                   1999/01/23                          7

GCC(1)                      GNU Tools                      GCC(1)

              ing  nothing about the number of arguments or their
              types (C++ only).  Normally, such a declaration  in
              C++ means that the function foo takes no arguments.

       -trigraphs
              Support ANSI C trigraphs.  The `-ansi'  option  im-
              plies `-trigraphs'.

       -traditional
              Attempt  to  support  some aspects of traditional C
              compilers.  For details, see the GNU C Manual;  the
              duplicate  list  here  has  been deleted so that we
              won't get complaints when it is out of date.

              But one note  about  C++  programs  only  (not  C).
              `-traditional'  has  one additional effect for C++:
              assignment to this is permitted.  This is the  same
              as the effect of `-fthis-is-variable'.

       -traditional-cpp
              Attempt  to  support  some aspects of traditional C
              preprocessors.   This  includes  the   items   that
              specifically  mention  the  preprocessor above, but
              none of the other effects of `-traditional'.

       -fdollars-in-identifiers
              Permit the use of `$' in  identifiers  (C++  only).
              You  can  also use `-fno-dollars-in-identifiers' to
              explicitly prohibit use of `$'.   (GNU  C++  allows
              `$'  by default on some target systems but not oth-
              ers.)

       -fenum-int-equiv
              Permit implicit conversion of  int  to  enumeration
              types  (C++ only).  Normally GNU C++ allows conver-
              sion of enum to int, but not the other way  around.

       -fexternal-templates
              Produce  smaller code for template declarations, by
              generating only a  single  copy  of  each  template
              function  where  it  is defined (C++ only).  To use

GCC(1)                      GNU Tools                      GCC(1)

              tions are explicitly internal.

       -fall-virtual
              Treat all possible member functions as virtual, im-
              plicitly.  All member functions  (except  for  con-
              structor  functions and new or delete member opera-
              tors) are treated as virtual functions of the class
              where they appear.

              This  does  not mean that all calls to these member
              functions will be made through the  internal  table
              of  virtual  functions.   Under some circumstances,
              the compiler can determine that a call to  a  given
              virtual  function  can  be  made directly; in these
              cases the calls are direct in any case.

       -fcond-mismatch
              Allow conditional expressions with mismatched types
              in  the  second  and third arguments.  The value of
              such an expression is void.

       -fthis-is-variable
              Permit assignment to this (C++ only).  The incorpo-
              ration  of  user-defined free store management into
              C++ has made assignment to `this'  an  anachronism.
              Therefore,  by  default  it is invalid to assign to
              this within a class member function.  However,  for
              backwards compatibility, you can make it valid with
              `-fthis-is-variable'.

       -funsigned-char
              Let the type char be unsigned, like unsigned  char.

              Each  kind  of  machine has a default for what char
              should be.  It is either like unsigned char by  de-
              fault or like signed char by default.

              Ideally,  a  portable  program  should  always  use
              signed char or unsigned char when it depends on the
              signedness  of  an  object.  But many programs have
              been written to use plain char and expect it to  be
              signed,  or  expect it to be unsigned, depending on
              the machines they were written for.   This  option,
              and  its  inverse, let you make such a program work
              with the opposite default.

              The type char is always a distinct type  from  each
              of  signed  char and unsigned char, even though its

       -fsigned-bitfields

       -funsigned-bitfields

       -fno-signed-bitfields

       -fno-unsigned-bitfields
              These  options control whether a bitfield is signed
              or  unsigned,  when  declared  with   no   explicit
              `signed' or `unsigned' qualifier.  By default, such
              a bitfield is signed, because this  is  consistent:
              the  basic  integer  types  such  as int are signed
              types.

              However, when you specify `-traditional', bitfields
              are all unsigned no matter what.

       -fwritable-strings
              Store string constants in the writable data segment
              and don't uniquize them.  This is for compatibility
              with  old programs which assume they can write into
              string constants.  `-traditional' also has this ef-
              fect.

              Writing  into  string constants is a very bad idea;
              "constants" should be constant.

PREPROCESSOR OPTIONS

       These options control the C preprocessor, which is run  on
       each C source file before actual compilation.

       If  you  use the `-E' option, GCC does nothing except pre-
       processing.  Some of these options make sense only togeth-
       er with `-E' because they cause the preprocessor output to
       be unsuitable for actual compilation.

       -include file
              Process file as input before processing the regular
              input  file.   In  effect, the contents of file are
              compiled first.  Any `-D' and `-U' options  on  the
              command  line are always processed before `-include
              file', regardless of the order in  which  they  are
              written.  All the `-include' and `-imacros' options
              are processed in the order in which they are  writ-
              ten.

       -imacros file
              Process  file  as  input,  discarding the resulting
              output, before processing the regular  input  file.
              Because  the output generated from file is discard-

              Add  the  directory dir to the second include path.
              The directories on  the  second  include  path  are
              searched  when a header file is not found in any of
              the directories in the main include path  (the  one
              that `-I' adds to).

       -iprefix prefix
              Specify   prefix   as  the  prefix  for  subsequent
              `-iwithprefix' options.

       -iwithprefix dir
              Add a directory to the second  include  path.   The
              directory's  name  is  made by concatenating prefix
              and dir, where prefix was specified previously with
              `-iprefix'.

       -nostdinc
              Do  not  search the standard system directories for
              header files.  Only the directories you have speci-
              fied  with `-I' options (and the current directory,
              if appropriate) are searched.

              By using both `-nostdinc' and `-I-', you can  limit
              the include-file search file to only those directo-
              ries you specify explicitly.

       -nostdinc++
              Do not search for header files in the  C++-specific
              standard directories, but do still search the other
              standard directories.  (This option  is  used  when
              building `libg++'.)

       -undef Do  not predefine any nonstandard macros.  (Includ-
              ing architecture flags).

       -E     Run only the C preprocessor.  Preprocess all the  C
              source  files  specified  and output the results to
              standard output or to the specified output file.

       -C     Tell the  preprocessor  not  to  discard  comments.
              Used with the `-E' option.

       -P     Tell  the preprocessor not to generate `#line' com-
              mands.  Used with the `-E' option.

       -M  [ -MG ]
              Tell the preprocessor to output a rule suitable for
              make  describing  the  dependencies  of each object
              addition to `-M'.

       -MM  [ -MG ]
              Like `-M' but the output  mentions  only  the  user
              header files included with `#include "file"'.  Sys-
              tem header files included  with  `#include  <file>'
              are omitted.

       -MD    Like `-M' but the dependency information is written
              to files with names made  by  replacing  `.o'  with
              `.d'  at the end of the output file names.  This is
              in   addition   to   compiling    the    file    as
              specified--`-MD' does not inhibit ordinary compila-
              tion the way `-M' does.

              The Mach utility `md' can be used to merge the `.d'
              files  into  a  single dependency file suitable for
              using with the `make' command.

       -MMD   Like `-MD' except mention only user  header  files,
              not system header files.

       -H     Print  the  name of each header file used, in addi-
              tion to other normal activities.

       -Aquestion(answer)
              Assert the answer answer for question, in  case  it
              is  tested  with a preprocessor conditional such as
              `#if #question(answer)'.  `-A-' disables the  stan-
              dard  assertions  that normally describe the target
              machine.

       -Dmacro
              Define macro macro with the string `1' as its defi-
              nition.

       -Dmacro=defn
              Define  macro  macro  as  defn.    All instances of
              `-D' on the command line are processed  before  any
              `-U' options.
       -dN    Like `-dD' except that the macro arguments and con-
              tents are omitted.  Only `#define name' is included
              in the output.

ASSEMBLER OPTION

       -Wa,option
              Pass  option as an option to the assembler.  If op-
              tion contains commas, it is split into multiple op-
              tions at the commas.

LINKER OPTIONS

       These  options  come into play when the compiler links ob-
       ject files into an executable output file.  They are mean-
       ingless if the compiler is not doing a link step.

       object-file-name
              A  file  name that does not end in a special recog-
              nized suffix is considered to name an  object  file
              or  library.   (Object files are distinguished from
              libraries by the linker according to the file  con-
              tents.)   If  GCC  does  a  link step, these object
              files are used as input to the linker.

       -llibrary
              Use the library named library when linking.

              The linker searches a standard list of  directories
              for  the  library,  which  is actually a file named
              `liblibrary.a'.  The linker then uses this file  as
              if it had been specified precisely by name.

GNU Tools                   1999/01/23                         13

GCC(1)                      GNU Tools                      GCC(1)

              The  directories  searched include several standard
              system directories plus any that you  specify  with
              `-L'.

              Normally  the  files  found  this  way  are library
              files--archive  files  whose  members  are   object
              files.  The linker handles an archive file by scan-
              ning through it for members  which  define  symbols
              that  have  so far been referenced but not defined.
              However, if the linker  finds  an  ordinary  object
              file  rather  than  a  library,  the object file is
              linked in the usual fashion.  The  only  difference
              between  using an `-l' option and specifying a file
              name is that `-l' surrounds library with `lib'  and
              `.a' and searches several directories.

       -lobjc You  need this special case of the -l option in or-
              systems, this option has no effect.

       -shared
              Produce a shared object which can  then  be  linked
              with  other  objects to form an executable.  Only a
              few systems support this option.

       -symbolic
              Bind references to global symbols when  building  a
              shared  object.   Warn  about any unresolved refer-
              ences (unless overridden by the link editor  option
              `-Xlinker  -z  -Xlinker defs').  Only a few systems
              support this option.

       -Xlinker option
              Pass option as an option to the  linker.   You  can
              use  this  to supply system-specific linker options
              which GNU CC does not know how to recognize.

              If you want to pass an option that takes  an  argu-
              ment,  you  must use `-Xlinker' twice, once for the
              option and once for the argument.  For example,  to
              pass `-assert definitions', you must write `-Xlink-

GNU Tools                   1999/01/23                         14

GCC(1)                      GNU Tools                      GCC(1)

              er -assert -Xlinker definitions'.  It does not work
              to  write `-Xlinker "-assert definitions"', because
              this passes the entire string as a single argument,
              which is not what the linker expects.

       -Wl,option
              Pass  option as an option to the linker.  If option
              contains commas, it is split into multiple  options
              at the commas.

       -u symbol
              Pretend  the  symbol  symbol is undefined, to force
              linking of library modules to define it.   You  can
              use  `-u'  multiple times with different symbols to
              force loading of additional library modules.

DIRECTORY OPTIONS

       These options specify directories  to  search  for  header
       files, for libraries and for parts of the compiler:

       -Idir  Append  directory  dir  to  the list of directories
              searched for include files.

       -I-    Any directories you specify with `-I'  options  be-
              searching  the directory which was current when the
              compiler was invoked.  That is not exactly the same
              as what the preprocessor does by default, but it is
              often satisfactory.

              `-I-' does not inhibit the use of the standard sys-
              tem  directories for header files.  Thus, `-I-' and
              `-nostdinc' are independent.

       -Ldir  Add directory dir to the list of directories to  be
              searched for `-l'.

       -Bprefix
              This  option  specifies  where to find the executa-
              bles, libraries and data files of the compiler  it-
              self.

GCC(1)                      GNU Tools                      GCC(1)

              The compiler driver program runs one or more of the
              subprograms `cpp', `cc1' (or, for C++,  `cc1plus'),
              `as'  and  `ld'.   It  tries prefix as a prefix for
              each program it tries to run, both with and without
              `machine/version/'.

              For  each subprogram to be run, the compiler driver
              first tries the `-B' prefix, if any.  If that  name
              is  not  found,  or  if `-B' was not specified, the
              driver  tries  two  standard  prefixes,  which  are
              `/usr/lib/gcc/'  and `/usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/'.  If
              neither of those results in a  file  name  that  is
              found, the compiler driver searches for the unmodi-
              fied program name, using the directories  specified
              in your `PATH' environment variable.

              The   run-time  support  file  `libgcc.a'  is  also
              searched for using the `-B' prefix, if needed.   If
              it  is  not  found there, the two standard prefixes
              above are tried, and that is all.  The file is left
              out  of the link if it is not found by those means.
              Most of the time, on most machines,  `libgcc.a'  is
              not actually necessary.

              You  can  get a similar result from the environment
              variable GCC_EXEC_PREFIX; if  it  is  defined,  its
              value is used as a prefix in the same way.  If both
              the `-B' option and  the  GCC_EXEC_PREFIX  variable
              are  present, the `-B' option is used first and the
              environment variable value second.

       -Wno-import
              Inhibit warning messages about the use of  #import.

              erly with or without this option (though a rare few
              will  require  `-ansi').  However, without this op-
              tion, certain GNU extensions and traditional C fea-
              tures  are  supported  as  well.  With this option,
              they are rejected.  There is no reason to use  this
              option; it exists only to satisfy pedants.

              `-pedantic' does not cause warning messages for use
              of the alternate keywords whose names begin and end
              with  `__'.  Pedantic warnings are also disabled in
              the expression that follows __extension__.   Howev-
              er,  only  system header files should use these es-
              cape  routes;  application  programs  should  avoid
              them.

       -pedantic-errors
              Like  `-pedantic',  except that errors are produced
              rather than warnings.

       -W     Print extra warning messages for these events:

          o   A nonvolatile automatic variable might  be  changed
              by  a call to longjmp.  These warnings are possible
              only in optimizing compilation.

              The compiler sees only the  calls  to  setjmp.   It
              cannot  know where longjmp will be called; in fact,
              a signal handler could call it at any point in  the
              code.  As a result, you may get a warning even when
              there is in fact no problem because longjmp  cannot
              in  fact be called at the place which would cause a
              problem.

              considered returning without a value.)   For  exam-
              ple, this function would evoke such a warning:

              will  cause a warning, but `x[(void)i,j]' will not.
