with two possible answers - one correct (yes) and one incorrect (no)


Mark the correct and incorrect assertions about pointers.
(yes) A pointer denotes the location of a value in memory.
(no)  The operator -> is used to access a data member or a member function through an object.


Mark the correct and incorrect definitions.
(yes) int* p = new int;
(no)  int pp = new int;


We have the following variable definitions:
   int* pt1;
   int p = 2,;
   int* pt2 = new int;
Mark the correct and incorrect statements.
(yes)*pt1 = p;
(no) p = pt2;


We have the following variable definitions:
   int a[3] = {10, 20, 30};
   int* pa = a;
Mark the expressions which have the value 30.
(yes) a[0] + a[1]
(no)  *pa + *a


Mark the correct and incorrect definitions.
(yes)char hello[] = "Hello";
(no) char one[1] = "1";


We have the folloing classes:
  class Point {
  ... };
  class Circle : public Point {
  ... };
Mark the correct and incorrect assertions about the classes Point and Circle.
(yes)The class Point is the base class and the class Circle is the derived class.
(no) The data members of the class Circle are present in each object of the class Point.


We have the following classes definitions:
   class A {
   public:
     void af();
   ... };
   class B : public A {
   public:
     void bf();
   ... };
and objects oa from the class A and ob from the class B.
Mark the (syntax) correct and incorrect statements in the body of the main function.
(yes) oa.af();
(no)  B::af();


Suppose the class D inherits from B. Let b be an object of the class B,
d be an object of the class D, pb be a pointer of the class B and
pd be a pointer of the class D. Which of the following assignments are legal?
(yes) b = d;
(no) *pd = *pb;


Mark the correct and incorrect assertions about pointers.
(no)  When a member function is invoked through a pointer, it is always statically bound.
(yes) Only member functions can be dynamically bound.
