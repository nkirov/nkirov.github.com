The questions of Test_2
with two possible answers - one correct (yes) and one incorrect (no)


Mark the correct and incorrect assertions about inheritance
hierarchy of stream classes.
(yes) The fstream class derives from iostream.
(no) The iostream class derives from ifstream and ofstream.

Mark the correct and incorrect assertions about stream classes, objects and
member functions.
(yes) An object of istream class is a source of bytes.
(no) The object cin belongs to a class that is derived from ifstream.

We have the following file variables:
   ifstream fin;
   ofstream fout;
   fstream f;
and the variables:
   int k = 10;
   double x = 15.5;
   char ch = 'N';
   string s = "alabala";
Mark the correct and incorrect statements.
(yes) fout << x;
(no) fin.get(s);

We have the following function definition:
   long fact(int n)
   {  if (n <= 1) return 1;
      else
      {  long result = n * fact(n - 1);
         return result;
      }
   }
and a statement in the block of the main function. When the statement
prints out the value 24, mark it with "yes", otherwise mark it with "no".
(yes) cout << fact(4);
(no) cout << fact(5);

Replace the dots ... with the given statement and mark "yes"
the cases when the output of the program contains the triple
of the successive digits 121.
 
void ret121(int i)
   {  ...
      if (i / 10 != 0) ret121(i/10);
   }
   int main()
   {  ret121(122);
      return 0;
   }
(yes) cout << i;
(no) cout << i % 10;

We have the following program:
   #include <iostream>
   using namespace std;
   int main(int argc, char* argv[])
   {  cout << argc << " "
      << static_cast<string>(argv[1]) << endl;
      return 0;
   }
The name of the executable file of this program is prog.
Also invoking the program from the command line
(with command line arguments) is given.
When the program prints out the numbers 3 3,
mark the command line with "yes", otherwise mark it with "no".
(yes) >prog 3 3
(no) >prog

Mark the correct and incorrect assertions about object-oriented design.
(yes) A class depends of another class if it uses objects of that other class.
(no) Inheritance is ``has-a'' relationship between classes.

What relationship is more appropriate between the following classes:
association, inheritance, or neither? Mark the association with "yes",
inheritance with "no" and nether with "0".
(yes) University - Student
(no) Student - TeachingAssistant
(0) Student - Professor
