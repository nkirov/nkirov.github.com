Mark the correct and incorrect assertions about Sorting and Searching.
(yes) Selection sort is based upon finding the minimum value in a range of indexes and placing that value at the front of the vector.
(no) Selection sort is an O(n) algorithm.


If it takes 4 seconds to sort 10000 records for both sorts
(merge sort is really faster, of course) then

(no) it will take < 10 hours to selection sort 2000000 records.


Can the following row be a definition of the destructor of a class?
(yes) Department::~Department() {}
(no) bool De::~De(int k) { return k>0; }


Is it possible to overload the next operators with the well-known
class Time using the given nonmember function declaration?
(yes) int operator-(Time, Time);
(no) Time operator<(Time);


Mark the correct and incorrect statements about
Templates and Exceptions Handling.
(yes) A class template is a mechanism that allows us to create classes whose data fields have arbitrary type.
(no) The keyword throw indicates that the function returns to the caller.


Mark the correct and incorrect pointer definitions.
(yes) int* pint = new int;
(no) int* pid = new double;


Replace the dots ... with the given number and mark "yes"
the cases when the output of the program coincides with the sequence
of digits written after ->.
   int dig(int n)
   {  cout << n;
      if (n > 9) return dig(n/10) + 1;
      else return 1;
   }
   int main()
   {  cout << dig(...);
      return 0;
   }
(yes)122 -> 1221213
(no)13 -> 133


We have the following classes: 
   class Employee {
   ... };
   class Manager : public Employee {
   ... }; 
Mark the correct and incorrect assertions about the classes
Employee and Manager.
(yes) The class Employee is the base class and the class Manager is the derived class.
(no) The data members of the class Manager are present in each object of the class Employee.


We have the following definitions:
   ifstream inp;
   ofstream out;
   int k = 100;
   char ch = 'Z';
   const double PIN = 5.55;
Mark the syntax correct and incorrect statements.
(yes) out << PIN*k << "\n";
(no) inp << PIN*k << "\n";
