<span class="heading">About The Program</span>
<p>The Computer Networking program is a joint effort between the
Colleges of Engineering and Management to deliver a unique educational
program that addresses the needs of North Carolina's computer
networking industry. By working together,the colleges deliver a
curriculum that allows students the flexibility to pursue
concentrations that emphasize the technical or management aspects of
computer networking, or some combination of the two.</p>
<p>The program is intended for students with engineering or computer
science undergraduate degrees who wish to pursue careers in research,
development, operations, and information technology management in the
computer networking industry and electronic commerce. It is designed to
address a specific need in an industry that is growing rapidly in North
Carolina, and, as such, is consistent with the land-grant mission of
the university. The program is unique in the UNC system (and
nationally) in blending the technical and management aspects of
computer networking to offer students a truly unique educational
opportunity.</p>
<p>Students may <a href="http://networking.ncsu.edu/admissions.php">apply for admission</a>
to the M.S. in Computer Networking degree through either the Department
of Computer Science or the Department of Electrical and Computer
Engineering.</p>
