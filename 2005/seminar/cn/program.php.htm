<span class="heading">Program Requirements</span>
<p><span class="heading2">Description Of The Degree Program</span></p>
<p>The Master of Science degree in Computer Networking may be earned through either of: </p>
<ul>
	<li>
<a href="#OptionA">Option A</a> - The MS with thesis option</li>
	<li>
<a href="#OptionB">Option B</a> - The MS without thesis option.</li>
</ul>
<p>Either option of the MS degree may be used as preparation for
further graduate study or employment in an industrial research,
development, or design environment. Students planning to continue to
the Ph.D. should discuss the option selected with their advisors. </p>
<p><u>Credit-Hour Requirements:</u><br>
A minimum of 30 credit hours is required for all students. The Computer
Networking core courses constitute 9 of these 30 credit hours. Students
must take 12 credit hours of additional computer networking courses
from one of three technical concentration areas. Each technical
concentration area includes both required and elective courses.</p>
<p>The remaining 9 credit hours may be taken from either</p>
<ul>
	<li>An approved management concentration sequence </li>
	<li>Additional courses from the Computer Networking technical concentration areas</li>
	<li>Pool of graduate level CSC courses</li>
	<li>Pool of graduate level ECE courses that form the CPE major (refer to the ECE graduate student handbook)</li>
</ul>
<p>The above is the only way of earning the 9 credits for students
pursuing the MS without-thesis option. Students earning the MS with a
thesis option may substitute a maximum of six credit hours of the 9
with thesis work (ECE or CSC 695) <i>At least 6 of the 30 credits must come from the 700-level. Individual study courses cannot account for more than 3 credit hours.</i></p>
<p><a href="http://networking.ncsu.edu/courses.php#Core">Core Course Requirements</a><br>All students must take the following three core courses for a total of 9 credit hours:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
<a href="http://www2.acs.ncsu.edu/reg_records/crs_cat/ECE.html#ECE570">CSC/ECE 570</a>: Computer Networks
	</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www2.acs.ncsu.edu/reg_records/crs_cat/ECE.html#ECE579">CSC/ECE 579</a>: Computer Performance Modeling
	</li>
<li>One BUS course from the <a href="http://networking.ncsu.edu/courses.php#BusinessCore">approved list</a>.
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://networking.ncsu.edu/courses.php#Technical%20Concentrations">Technical Concentrations</a><br>All
students must earn 12 credits by taking four courses from one of the
defined technical concentration areas for the MS Computer Networking
degree. Each technical concentration has a set of courses that are
required for students electing that concentration.</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://networking.ncsu.edu/courses.php#Design">Network Design</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://networking.ncsu.edu/courses.php#Hardware">Network Hardware</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://networking.ncsu.edu/courses.php#Software">Network Software</a></li>
</ul>
<p><u>The remaining 9 hours of credit</u><br>Students in the MS without-thesis program <a href="#OptionB">(Option B)</a> can either take three approved electives chosen from any of the approved
         <a href="http://networking.ncsu.edu/courses.php#Technical">technical</a> or <a href="http://networking.ncsu.edu/courses.php#Management">management </a>concentration areas, or earn a <a href="http://networking.ncsu.edu/courses.php#Management">Management Concentration</a>
by completing a three-course sequence in management from the approved
list for the MS Computer Networking degree. Students pursuing the MS
with thesis option <a href="#OptionA">(Option A)</a> may use a maximum of six credit hours of the remaining 9 hours for thesis research.</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="OptionA"><span class="heading">Option A - MS with Thesis</span></a></p>
<p>A student who wishes to pursue the MS with thesis option must find a
member of the ECE or CSC Graduate Faculty who agrees to serve as the
student's advisory committee chair and direct the student's thesis
research. If the chair becomes unable or unwilling to direct the work
to completion, and the student is unable to find another graduate
faculty member willing to direct the work, the student will be required
to transfer to the non-thesis option.</p>
<p><u>Advisory Committee:</u><br>Each MS with thesis student must form
an advisory committee by the end of the semester in which nine or more
credits are completed toward the degree sought. The advisory committee
must consist of three members of the graduate faculty.</p>
<p><u>Thesis Research:</u><br> A student pursuing the MS with thesis
may apply a maximum of 6 credits of CSC or ECE 695, Thesis
Research/Thesis Preparation, toward the minimum 30 hour requirement.</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="OptionB"><span class="heading">Option B - MS without Thesis</span></a></p>
<p>A Master of Science may be obtained without a thesis (Option B). CNE
non-thesis students must formally select a non-thesis advisor during
their first semester. CNC non-thesis students are not required to
select a non-thesis advisor. Their advisor is Dr. Perros, the CSC
program Coordinator for the Masters in Computer Networking.</p>
<p><a href="http://networking.ncsu.edu/courses.php#Management">Management Concentrations:</a><br>
Students may elect a three-course sequence from an approved list of
management concentrations for the MS Computer Networking degree.</p>
<hr>
<p><span class="heading">All Students</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Must take a minimum of 30 credit hours.</li>
<li>Must take a minimum of 6 credit hours of Computer Networking courses at the 700 level.</li>
<li>Credit for Thesis Research is not allowed for Option B, the MS without thesis.</li> 
<li>Non-letter grade courses, such as individual studies courses, may account for a maximum of 3 of the required 30 credit hours.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="heading2">Core Course Requirements</span> (9 Credit Hours)</p>
<ul>
             <li>

</ul>
<p><span class="heading2">Technical Concentration</span> (12 Credit Hours)</p>
<p>Students in the MS Computer Networking program must take four
Computer Networking courses (12 credit hours) from a technical

defined: </p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://networking.ncsu.edu/courses.php#Design">Network Design</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://networking.ncsu.edu/courses.php#Hardware">Network Hardware</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://networking.ncsu.edu/courses.php#Software">Network Software</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Within each technical concentration area, there are required courses
which must be taken by all students electing that technical
concentration. For some concentration areas, the required courses may
constitute the entire 12 credits.</p>
<p><span class="heading2">Management Concentration, Approved Electives, or Thesis Option </span> (12 Credit Hours)</p>
<p>For the remaining 9 credit hours, students may elect one of three options:</p>
<ul>
	<li>

	<li>
<a href="http://networking.ncsu.edu/courses.php#Technical">Approved Electives</a><br>Three courses chosen from any of the approved technical concentration or management concentration areas.</li>
	<li>

credit hours of thesis research, plus one additional course from any of
the approved technical concentration or management concentration area</li>
</ul>
