            <p>Welcome to ANSI/ISO Standard C++! At Deitel &amp;
Associates, we write college-level programming-language textbooks and
professional books and work hard to keep our published books up-to-date
with a steady flow of new editions. Writing <i>C++ How to Program,
Fourth Edition,</i> (<i>4/e</i> for short), was a joy. This book and
its support materials have everything instructors and students need for
an informative, interesting, challenging and entertaining C++
educational experience. As the book goes to publication, it is
compliant with the latest version of the ANSI/ISO C++ Standard (one of
the most important worldwide standards for the computing community) and
with object-oriented design using the latest version of the UML
(Unified Modeling Language) from the Object Management Group (OMG). We
tuned the writing, the pedagogy, our coding style, the book’s ancillary
package and even added a substantial treatment of developing Internet-
and Web-based applications. We have added a comprehensive Tour of the
Book section to Chapter 1. This will help instructors, students and
professionals get a sense of the rich coverage the book provides of C++
object-oriented programming, object-oriented design with the UML and
generic programming. If you are evaluating the book, please read the
Tour of the Book now in pages 44–56.</p>
            <p>Whether you are an instructor, a student, an experienced
professional or a novice programmer, this book has much to offer. C++
is a world-class programming language for developing
industrial-strength, high-performance computer applications. We
carefully audited the manuscript against the ANSI/ISO C++ standard
document, which defines C++, and we were privileged to have as a
reviewer Steve Clamage of Sun Microsystems who heads the ANSI J16
Committee responsible for evolving the C++ standard. As a result, the
programs you create by studying this text should port easily to any
ANSI/ISO-compliant compiler.</p>
            <p>In this Preface, we overview <i>C++ How to Program, 4/e’</i>s
comprehensive suite of educational materials that help instructors
maximize their students’ C++ learning experience. We explain
conventions we use, such as syntax coloring the code examples, "code
washing" and highlighting important code segments to help focus
students’ attention on the key concepts introduced in each chapter. We
overview the new features of <i>C++ How to Program, 4/e</i>, including
our early treatment of arrays and strings as objects, an enhanced
treatment of object-oriented programming, Web-application development
with CGI, the enhanced elevator-simulation object-oriented design (OOD)
case study with the UML, and the extensive use of UML diagrams that
have been upgraded to UML version 1.4 standards. </p>
            <p>Prentice Hall has bundled <i>Microsoft’s Visual C++<sup>®</sup>
6 Introductory Edition</i> software with the text and offers a separate
value-pack containing <i>C++ How to Program, 4/e</i>, with Metrowerks <i>
CodeWarrior</i> for the Macintosh and Windows. We list several
compilers that are available on the Web free for download. To further
support novice programmers, we offer six of our new <i>Dive-into™</i> <i>Series</i>
publications that are available free for download at <span class="cdt"><a href="http://www.deitel.com/">www.deitel.com</a></span>. These
materials explain how to compile, execute and debug C++ programs using
various popular C++ development environments.</p>
            <p>We overview the complete package of ancillary materials
available to instructors and students using <i>C++ How to Program, 4/e</i>.
These include an <i>Instructor’s Resource CD</i> with solutions to the
book’s chapter exercises and a <i>Test-Item File</i> with hundreds of
multiple-choice questions and answers. Additional instructor resources
are available at the book’s Companion Web Site (<span class="cdt"><a href="http://www.prenhall.com/deitel">www.prenhall.com/deitel</a></span>),
which includes a <i>Syllabus Manager</i> and customizable PowerPoint<sup>®</sup>
Lecture Notes. Numerous support materials are available for students at
the Companion Web Site, as well. For instructors who want to hold
closed-lab sessions (or highly structured homework assignments), we
provide the optional, for-sale manual, <i>C++ in the Lab</i>. This
publication includes carefully constructed Prelab Activities, Lab
Exercises and Postlab Activities. </p>
            <p>This Preface also discusses <i>The C++ Multimedia Cyber
Classroom, 4/e</i>, an interactive, multimedia CD-based version of the
book. This learning aid provides audio "walkthroughs" of programs,
animations of programs executing and hundreds of exercises and
solutions. We describe how to order both the Cyber Classroom and <i>The
Complete C++ Training Course, 4/e</i>, boxed product, which contains
the Cyber Classroom and the textbook. </p>
            <p>We discuss several Deitel™ e-learning initiatives,
including an explanation of Deitel content available for the <i>Blackboard</i>,
            <i>CourseCompass</i> and <i>WebCT </i>Course Management
Systems, each of which supports <i>C++ How to Program, 4/e</i>. <i>Premium
CourseCompass</i>, which offers enhanced Deitel content based on <i>The
C++ Multimedia Cyber Classroom, 4/e</i>, will be available in January
2003.</p>
            <p> <i>C++ How to Program, 4/e</i>, was reviewed by 52

            <p><b>Features of C++ How to Program, Fourth Edition</b></p>
            <p>This book contains many features including:</p>
            <p><i><b>Full-Color Presentation</b></i></p>
            <p>This book is in full color to show programs and their
outputs as they typically would appear on a computer screen. We syntax
color all the C++ code, as do many C++ integrated-development
environments and code editors. This greatly improves code
readability—an especially important goal, given that this book contains
over 20,000 lines of code. Our syntax-coloring conventions are as
follows:</p>
            <p><span class="cdt" style="color: rgb(0, 255, 0);">comments
appear in green</span><br>
            <span class="cdt" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);">keywords
appear in dark blue</span><br>
            <span class="cdt" style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">errors
appear in red</span><br>
            <span class="cdt" style="color: rgb(0, 255, 255);">constants
and literal values appear in light blue</span><br>
            <span class="cdt">all other code appears in black</span></p>
            <p><i><b>Code Highlighting and User-Input Highlighting</b></i></p>
            <p align="justify">We have added extensive code
highlighting. In our code walkthroughs (at Deitel, we call these
"writearounds"), we have eliminated most of the "redundant" code
snippets that appeared inline in the text in the Third Edition. We kept
them in the earliest portion of the book as a pedagogic device to help
novices. We want the reader to see all new code features in context, so
from Chapter 3 forward, our code walkthroughs simply refer to the line
numbers of the new code segments inside complete source programs. To
make it easier for readers to spot the featured segments, we have
highlighted them in bright yellow. This feature also helps students
review the material rapidly when preparing for exams or labs. We have
also highlighted in our screen dialogs all user inputs to distinguish
them from program outputs.</p>
            <p align="justify"><b><i>"Code Washing"</i></b></p>
            <p align="justify">Code washing is our term for applying
comments, using meaningful identifiers, applying indentation and using
vertical spacing to separate meaningful program units. This process
results in programs that are much more readable and self-documenting.
We have done extensive "code washing" of all the source code programs
in the text, the lab manual, the ancillaries and the Cyber Classroom. </p>
            <p align="justify"><i><b>Early Introduction of Standard
Library </b> <span class="cdt">string</span><b> and </b> <span class="cdt">vector</span><b> Objects</b></i></p>
            <p align="justify">Object-oriented programming languages
generally offer the ability to create string and array objects by
instantiating them from library classes or from programmer-defined
classes. It is also important for students learning C++ to become
familiar with C-style, pointer-based arrays and strings, because of the
massive amount of C and early C++ legacy code they will encounter in
industry. In C++ How to Program, 4/e, we show all three means of
creating strings and arrays. In Chapters 4 and 5 we show the
traditional, C-like pointer-based arrays and strings, respectively. In
Chapter 8, Operator Overloading, we create our own user-defined classes
            <span class="cdt">Array</span> and <span class="cdt">String</span>.
At the end of Chapter 8, we introduce library classes <span class="cdt">vector</span>
and <span class="cdt">string</span>, which we explain in detail in
Chapter 15 and Chapter 21, respectively. Through Chapter 8, we favor
pointer-based arrays and strings; after Chapter 8, we favor the library
classes. The Chapter 15 material on <span class="cdt">string</span>
could be taught at any point after Chapter 8. The Chapter 21 material
on <span class="cdt">vector</span> (and other aspects of the STL)
could also reasonably be taught after Chapter 8, although we recommend
covering Chapter 11, Templates, first.</p>
            <i><b>
            </b></i><p align="justify">Tuned Treatment of Object-Oriented
Programming in Chapters 9 and 10</p>
            
            <p align="justify">This is one of the most significant
improvements in this new edition. We performed a high-precision upgrade
to Chapters 9 and 10. The improvements make the material clearer and
more accessible to students and professionals, especially those
studying object-orientation for the first time.</p>
            <p align="justify"><i> <b>Redesigned Pedagogy of Chapter
9, Object-Oriented Programming: Inheritance</b></i>. </p>
            <p align="justify">The new Chapter 9 carefully walks the
reader through a five-example sequence that demonstrates <span class="cdt">private</span> data, <span class="cdt">protected</span>
data and software reuse via inheritance. We begin by demonstrating a
class with <span class="cdt">private</span> data members and <span class="cdt">public</span> member functions to manipulate that data.
Next, we implement a second class with several additional capabilities.
To do this, we duplicate much of the first example’s code. In our third
example, we begin our discussion of inheritance and software reuse—we
use the class from the first example as a base class and inherit its
data and functionality into a new derived class. This example
introduces the inheritance mechanism and demonstrates that a derived
class cannot access its base class’s <span class="cdt">private</span>
data directly. This motivates our fourth example, in which we introduce
            <span class="cdt">protected</span> data in the base class
and demonstrate that the derived class can indeed access its base
class’s <span class="cdt">protected</span> data. The last example in
the sequence demonstrates proper software engineering by defining the
base class’s data as <span class="cdt">private</span> and using the
base class’s <span class="cdt">public</span> member functions (that
were inherited by the derived class) to manipulate the base class’s <span class="cdt">private</span> data from the derived class. We follow the
five-part introduction with a three-level class hierarchy that employs
the software engineering techniques introduced earlier in the chapter.
The chapter closes with a discussion of the three inheritance types
supported by C++ and a general discussion of software engineering with
inheritance.</p>
            <i><b>
            </b></i><p align="justify">Redesigned Pedagogy of Chapter 10,
Object-Oriented Programming: Polymorphism.</p>
            
            <p align="justify">The new Chapter 10 builds on the
inheritance concepts presented in Chapter 9 and focuses on the
relationships between classes in a class hierarchy. Chapter 10 uses a
four-example sequence to present the powerful processing capabilities
that these relationships enable. We begin with an example that
illustrates the "is-a" relationship between a derived-class object and
its base-class type. This relationship enables the derived-class object
to be treated as an object of its base class. We show that we are able
to aim a base-class pointer at a derived-class object and invoke the
base-class’s functions on that object. In our second example, we
demonstrate that the reverse is not true—a base-class object is not
considered to be an object of its derived-class type—and we show that
compiler errors occur if a program attempts to manipulate a base-class
object in this manner. Our third example demonstrates that the only
functions which can be invoked through a base-class pointer are those
functions defined by the base class. The example shows that attempts to
invoke derived-class-only functions result in error messages. The last
example in the sequence introduces polymorphism with virtual functions,
which enable a program to process objects of classes related by a class
hierarchy as objects of their base-class type. When a virtual function
is invoked via a base-class pointer (or reference), the
derived-class-specific version of that function is invoked. The chapter
continues with a case study on polymorphism in which we process an
array of objects that all have a common abstract base class that
contains the set of functions common to every class in the hierarchy.
We follow this example with an in-depth discussion of how polymorphism
works "under the hood." We conclude with a case study that demonstrates
how a program that processes objects polymorphically can still perform
type-specific processing by determining at execution time the type of
the object currently being processed. </p>
            <i><b>
            </b></i><p align="justify">Web Applications Development with CGI</p>
            
            <p align="justify">The new Chapter 16, Web Programming with
CGI, has everything readers need to begin developing their own
Web-based applications that will run on the Internet! Readers will
learn how to build so-called <i>n</i>-tier applications, in which the
functionality provided by each tier can be distributed to separate
computers across the Internet or executed on the same computer. In
particular, we build a three-tier online bookstore application. The
bookstore's information is stored in the application’s data tier. In
industrial-strength applications, the data tier is typically a database
such as Oracle, Microsoft<sup>®</sup> SQL Server or MySQL. For
simplicity, we use text files and employ the file-processing techniques
of Chapter 14 to access these files. The user enters requests and
receives responses at the application’s client tier, which is typically
a computer running a Web browser such as Microsoft Internet Explorer or
Netscape<sup>®</sup>. Web browsers, of course, know how to communicate
with Web sites throughout the Internet. The middle tier contains both a
Web server and an application-specific C++ program (e.g., our bookstore
application). The Web server communicates with the C++ program (and
vice versa) via the CGI (Common Gateway Interface) protocol. We use the
popular Apache HTTP server as our Web server, which is available free
for download from <span class="cdt"><a href="http://www.apache.org/">www.apache.org</a></span>.
The Web server knows how to communicate with the client tier across the
Internet using the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP). We discuss the
crucial role of the Web server in Web programming and provide a simple
example that requests a Web page from a Web server. We discuss CGI and
how it allows a Web server to communicate with the top tier and CGI
scripts (i.e., our C++ programs). We provide a simple example that gets
the time and date from the server and renders it in a browser. In our
forms-based examples we use buttons, password fields, check boxes and
text fields. We present an example of an interactive portal for a
travel company that displays airfares to various cities. Travel-club
members can log in and view discounted airfares. We also discuss
various methods of storing client-specific data, which include hidden
fields (i.e., information stored in a Web page but not rendered by the
Web browser) and cookies—small text files that the browser stores on
the client’s machine. The chapter examples conclude with an e-business
case study of an online bookstore that allows users to add books to an
electronic shopping cart. This case study contains several CGI scripts
that interact with one another to form a complete application. The
online bookstore is password protected, so users first must log in to
gain access.</p>
            <i><b>
            </b></i><p align="justify">XHTML™</p>
            
            <p align="justify">The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has
declared HyperText Markup Language (HTML) to be a legacy technology
that will undergo no further development. HTML is being replaced by the
Extensible HyperText Markup Language (XHTML)—an XML-based technology
that rapidly is becoming the standard for describing Web content. We
use XHTML in Chapter 16, Web Programming with CGI; Appendix E presents
an XHTML introduction. If you are not familiar with XHTML, please read
Appendix E before reading Chapter 16.</p>
            <i><b>
            </b></i><p align="justify">Unified Modeling Language™ (UML)</p>
            
            <p align="justify">The Unified Modeling Language™ (UML) has
become the preferred graphical modeling language for designing
object-oriented systems. In C++ How to Program, Third Edition, we used
the UML in optional sections only, and we used conventional flowchart
segments and inheritance diagrams to reinforce the explanations. We
have fully converted the diagrams in the book to be UML 1.4 compliant.
In particular, we upgraded all the figures in the UML/OOD Elevator
Simulation case study; we converted all the flowcharts in Chapter 2,
Control Structures, to UML activity diagrams; and we converted all the
inheritance diagrams in Chapters 9, 12, 14 and 22 to UML class
diagrams. </p>
            <p align="justify">This <i>Fourth Edition</i> carefully
tunes the optional (but highly recommended) case study we present on
object-oriented design using the UML. In the case study, we fully
implement an elevator simulation. In the "Thinking About Objects"
sections at the ends of Chapters 1–7 and 9, we present a carefully
paced introduction to object-oriented design using the UML. We present
a concise, simplified subset of the UML then guide the reader through a
first design experience intended for the novice object-oriented
designer/programmer. The case study is fully solved. It is not an
exercise; rather, it is an end-to-end learning experience that
concludes with a detailed walkthrough of the C++ code. In each of the
first five chapters, we concentrate on the "conventional" methodology
of structured programming, because the objects that we build will use
these structured-program pieces. We conclude each chapter with a
"Thinking About Objects" section, in which we present an introduction
to object orientation using the UML. These "Thinking About Objects"
sections help students develop an object-oriented way of thinking, so
that they immediately can use the object-oriented programming concepts
they begin learning in Chapter 6. In the first of these sections at the
end of Chapter 1, we introduce basic concepts (i.e., "object think")
and terminology (i.e., "object speak"). In the optional "Thinking About
Objects" sections at the ends of Chapters 2–5, we consider more
substantial issues, as we undertake a challenging problem with the
techniques of object-oriented design (OOD). We analyze a typical
problem statement that requires a system to be built, determine the
objects needed to implement that system, determine the attributes these
objects need to have, determine the behaviors these objects need to
exhibit and specify how the objects need to interact with one another
to meet the system requirements. We accomplish this even before we
discuss how to write object-oriented C++ programs. In the "Thinking
About Objects" sections at the ends of Chapters 6, 7 and 9, we build a
C++ implementation of the object-oriented system we designed in the
earlier chapters. This project enabled us to incorporate topics that we
do not discuss in any other section of the book, including object
interaction, an in-depth discussion of handles, the philosophy of using
references vs. pointers and the use of forward declarations to avoid
circular-include problems. This case study will help prepare students
for the kinds of substantial projects they will encounter in industry.
We employ a carefully developed, incremental object-oriented design
process to produce a UML-based design for our elevator simulator. From
this design, we produce a substantial working C++ implementation using
key programming notions, including classes, objects, encapsulation,
visibility, composition and inheritance. </p>
            <i><b>
            </b></i><p align="justify">More About the (Optional) Elevator
Simulation Case Study</p>
            
            <p align="justify">This case study was introduced in C++
How to Program, 3/e, and was carefully tuned for the <i>Fourth Edition</i>.
We brought all the UML diagrams into compliance with version 1.4, we
reorganized many of the diagrams to make them clearer, we code washed
the complete C++ solution presented in the book, and we tuned the
discussions for clarity and precision. The case study was submitted to
a distinguished team of OOD/UML reviewers, including leaders in the
field from Rational (the creators of the UML) and the Object Management
Group (responsible for maintaining and evolving the UML). </p>
            <p align="justify">In Chapter 2, we begin the first phase
of the object-oriented design (OOD) for our elevator
simulator—identifying the classes needed to implement the simulator. We
also introduce the UML use case, class and object diagrams and the
concepts of associations, multiplicity, composition, roles and links.
In Chapter 3, we determine many of the class attributes needed to
implement the elevator simulator. We also introduce the UML statechart
and activity diagrams and the concepts of events and actions as they
relate to these diagrams. In Chapter 4, we determine many of the
operations (behaviors) of the classes in the elevator simulation. We
also introduce the UML sequence diagram and the concept of messages
sent between objects. In Chapter 5, we determine the collaboration
(sets of interactions among objects in the system) needed to implement
the elevator system and represent these interactions using the UML
collaboration diagram. We also include a bibliography and a list of
Internet and Web resources that contain the UML 1.4 specifications and
other reference materials, general resources, tutorials, FAQs,
articles, whitepapers and software. In Chapter 6, we use the UML class
diagram developed in previous sections to outline the C++ header files
that define our classes. We also introduce the concept of handles to
objects in the system, and we begin to study how to implement handles
in C++. In Chapter 7, we present a complete elevator simulator C++
program (approximately 1200 lines of code) and a detailed code
walkthrough. The code follows directly from the UML-based design
created in previous sections and employs our best programming
practices. We also discuss dynamic-memory allocation, composition,
object interaction via handles, and how to use forward declarations to
avoid the circular-include problem. In Chapter 9, we update the
elevator simulation design and implementation to incorporate
inheritance and suggest further modifications.</p>
            <i><b>
            </b></i><p align="justify">Standard Template Library (STL)</p>
            
            <p align="justify">This might be one of the most important
chapters in the book in terms of your appreciation of software reuse.
The STL defines powerful, template-based, reusable components that
implement many common data structures and algorithms used to process
those data structures. Chapter 21 introduces the STL and discusses its
three key components—containers, iterators and algorithms. STL
containers are data structures capable of storing objects of any data
type. We show that there are three container categories—first-class
containers, adapters and near containers. STL iterators, which are
similar to pointers (but much safer), are used by programs to
manipulate the STL-container elements. In fact, standard arrays can be
manipulated as STL containers, using standard pointers as iterators. We
show that manipulating containers with iterators is convenient and
provides tremendous expressive power when combined with STL
algorithms—in some cases, reducing many lines of code to a single
statement. STL algorithms are functions that perform common data
manipulations such as searching, sorting, comparing elements (or entire
data structures), etc. There are approximately 70 algorithms
implemented in the STL; these include common container operations such
as searching for an element, sorting elements, comparing elements,
removing elements, replacing elements and many more. Most of these
algorithms use iterators to access container elements. We show that
each first-class container supports specific iterator types, some of
which are more powerful than others. A container’s supported iterator
type determines whether the container can be used with a specific
algorithm. Iterators encapsulate the mechanism used to access container
elements. This encapsulation enables many of the STL algorithms to be
applied to a variety of containers without regard for the underlying
container implementation. As long as a container’s iterators support
the minimum requirements of the algorithm, the algorithm can process
that container’s elements. This also enables programmers to create
algorithms that can process the elements of multiple container types.
An advantage of the STL is that programmers can reuse the STL
containers, iterators and algorithms to implement common data
representations and manipulations. This reuse saves substantial
development time and resources. </p>
            <i><b>
            </b></i><p align="justify">Teaching Approach</p>
            
            <p align="justify">Our book is intended to be used at the
introductory and intermediate levels. We have not attempted to cover
every feature of the C++ standard. C++ has replaced C as the industry’s
high-performance systems-implementation language of choice. However, C
programming continues to be an important and valuable skill, because of
the enormous amount of C legacy code that must be maintained in
industry. We point out pitfalls and explain procedures for dealing with
them effectively. Students are highly motivated by the fact that they
are learning a leading-edge language (C++) and a leading-edge
programming paradigm (object-oriented programming) that will be
immediately useful to them as they leave the college environment. </p>
            <p align="justify"> <i>C++ How to Program, 4/e,</i>
contains a rich collection of examples, exercises and projects drawn
from many fields and designed to provide students with a chance to
solve interesting, real-world problems. The code examples in the text
have been tested on multiple compilers—Microsoft Visual C++ 6,
Microsoft Visual C++ .NET, two versions of Borland C++Builder and two
versions of GNU C++. For the most part, the programs in the text will
work on all ANSI/ISO standard-compliant compilers; we posted the few
problems we found at <span class="cdt"><a href="http://www.deitel.com/">www.deitel.com</a></span>.
When possible, we also posted the exact fixes required to enable those
programs to work with a particular compiler. </p>
            <p align="justify">The book concentrates on the principles
of good software engineering and stresses program clarity. We are

            <p align="justify"><i>C++ How to Program, 4/e,</i> is
loaded with numerous Live-Code™ examples. Each new concept is presented
in the context of a complete, working example that is immediately
followed by one or more sample executions showing the program’s
input/output dialog. This style exemplifies the way we teach and write
about programming and is the focus of our multimedia <i>Cyber
Classrooms</i> and Web-based training courses. We call this method of
teaching and writing the <i><b>Live-Code™ Approach</b></i>. <i> We
use programming languages to teach programming languages.</i> Reading
the examples in the text is much like typing and running them on a
computer. </p>
            <i><b>

            </b></i><p align="justify">Objectives</p>
            
            <p align="justify">Each chapter begins with objectives that
inform students of what to expect and gives them an opportunity, after
reading the chapter, to determine whether they have met the intended
objectives. The objectives serve as confidence builders.</p>
            <i><b>
            </b></i><p align="justify">Quotations</p>
            
            <p align="justify">The chapter objectives are followed by
sets of quotations. Some are humorous, some are philosophical and some
offer interesting insights. We have found that students enjoy relating
the quotations to the chapter material. Many of the quotations are
worth a second look after you read the chapters.</p>
            <i><b>
            </b></i><p align="justify">Outline</p>
            
            <p align="justify">The chapter outline enables students to
approach the material in a top-down fashion. Along with the chapter
objectives, the outline helps students anticipate future topics and set
a comfortable and effective learning pace. </p>

            </b></i><p align="justify">20,704 Lines of Syntax-Colored Code in
267 Example Programs (with Program Outputs)</p>
            
            <p align="justify">We present C++ features in the context
of complete, working C++ programs. These Live-Code™ programs range in
size from just a few lines of code to substantial examples containing
several hundred lines of code. Each program is followed by a window
containing the outputs produced when the program is run. This enables
the student to confirm that the programs run as expected. Relating
outputs back to the program statements that produce those outputs is an
excellent way to learn and to reinforce concepts. Our programs exercise
the diverse features of C++. The code is syntax colored with C++
keywords, comments and other program text each appearing in different
colors. This facilitates reading the code— students especially will
appreciate the syntax coloring when they read the larger programs we
present. All of the examples are available on the book’s CD and are
free for download at <span class="cdt"><a href="http://www.deitel.com/">www.deitel.com</a></span>.</p>

            </b></i><p align="justify">601 Programming Tips</p>
            
            <p align="justify">We have included six types of
programming tip to help students focus on important aspects of program
development, testing and debugging, performance and portability. We
highlight hundreds of these tips as Good Programming Practices, <i>Common
Programming Errors</i>, <i>Performance Tips</i>, <i>Portability Tips</i>,
            <i>Software Engineering Observations</i> and <i>Testing
and Debugging Tips</i>. These tips and practices represent the best we
could glean from almost six decades (combined) of programming and
teaching experience. One of our students—a mathematics major—told us
recently that she feels this approach is similar to the highlighting of
axioms, theorems and corollaries in mathematics books, because it
provides a sound basis on which to build good software.</p>
            <p align="justify"><b>90 Good Programming Practices</b></p>
            <p align="justify"><i>Good Programming Practices </i>are
tips that call attention to techniques that help students produce
programs that are more readable, self-documenting and easier to
maintain. When we teach introductory courses to nonprogrammers, we
state that the "buzzword" of each course is "clarity," and we tell the
students that we will highlight (in these <i>Good Programming Practices</i>)
techniques for writing programs that are clearer, more understandable
and more maintainable.</p>
            <i>
            </i><p align="justify"><b>198 Common Programming Errors</b></p>
            
            <p align="justify">Students learning a language—especially
in their first programming course—tend to make certain kinds of errors
frequently. Focusing on these <i>Common Programming Errors reduces the
likelihood that students will makes the same mistakes. It also shortens
long lines outside instructors’ offices during office hours! </i></p>
            <i>
            </i><p align="justify"><b>88 Performance Tips</b></p>
            
            <p align="justify">In our experience, teaching students to
write clear and understandable programs is by far the most important
goal for a first programming course. But students want to write the
programs that run the fastest, use the least memory, require the
smallest number of keystrokes or dazzle in other ways. Students really
care about performance and they want to know what they can do to
produce the most efficient programs. So we include <i>Performance Tips
            </i>that highlight opportunities for improving program
performance—making programs run faster or minimizing the amount of
memory that they occupy.</p>
            <i>
            </i><p align="justify"><b>36 Portability Tips</b></p>
            
            <p align="justify">Software development is a complex and
expensive activity. Organizations that develop software must often
produce versions customized to a variety of computers and operating
systems. So there is a strong emphasis today on portability, i.e., on
producing software that will run on a variety of computer systems with
few, if any, changes. Some programmers assume that if they implement an
application in standard C++, the application will be portable. This is
simply not the case. Achieving portability requires careful and
cautious design. There are many pitfalls. We include <i>Portability
Tips</i> to help students write portable code and to provide insights
on how C++ achieves its high degree of portability.</p>
            <i>
            </i><p align="justify"><b>149 Software Engineering Observations</b></p>
            
            <p align="justify">The object-oriented programming paradigm
necessitates a complete rethinking of the way we build software
systems. C++ is an effective language for achieving good software
engineering. The <i>Software Engineering Observations highlight
architectural and design issues, that affect the construction of
software systems, especially large-scale systems. Much of what the
student learns here will be useful in upper-level courses and in
industry as the student begins to work with large, complex real-world
systems.</i></p>
            <i>
            </i><p align="justify"></p>
            <p align="justify"><b>38 Testing and Debugging Tips</b></p>
            
            <p align="justify">When we first designed this "tip type,"
we thought the tips would contain suggestions strictly for exposing
bugs and removing them from programs. In fact, many of the tips
describe aspects of C++ that prevent "bugs" from getting into programs
in the first place, thus simplifying the testing and debugging process.</p>
            <i>
            </i><p align="justify"><b>Summary (875 Summary bullets)</b></p>
            
            <p align="justify">Each chapter ends with additional
pedagogical devices. We present a thorough, bullet-list-style summary
of the chapter. This helps the student review and reinforce key
concepts. There is an average of 40 summary bullets per chapter.</p>
            <i>
            </i><p align="justify"><b>Terminology (1782 Terms)</b></p>
            
            <p align="justify">We include an alphabetized list of the
important terms defined in the chapter in a Terminology section. Again,
this serves as further reinforcement. There are, on average, 81 terms
per chapter. Each term also appears in the index, so the reader can
locate terms and definitions quickly.</p>

Instructor’s Manual; Count Includes Separate Parts)</b></p>
            
            <p align="justify">Each chapter concludes with a
substantial set of exercises including simple recall of important
terminology and concepts; writing individual C++ statements; writing
small portions of C++ functions and classes; writing complete C++
functions, classes and programs; and writing major term projects. The
large number of exercises enables instructors to tailor their courses
to the unique needs of their audiences and to vary course assignments
each semester. Instructors can use these exercises to form homework
assignments, short quizzes and major examinations. The solutions for
the exercises are included on the Instructor’s CD which is available
only to instructors through their Prentice Hall representatives. [NOTE:

compilers, available for download from gcc.gnu.org. This product
contains compilers for C, C++, Java and other languages. The gcc
compiler is a command-line compiler (i.e., it does not provide a
graphical user interface). Many Linux and UNIX systems come with the
gcc compiler installed. Red Hat has developed Cygwin (<span class="cdt"><a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">www.cygwin.com</a></span>), an emulator

(www.borland.com/cbuilder/cppcomp/index.html). The basic C++Builder
compiler (a command-line compiler) is free for download. Borland also
provides several versions of the C++Builder that contain graphical user
interfaces (GUIs). These GUIs are more formally called integrated
development environments (IDEs), and, unlike command-line compilers,
enable the developer to edit, debug and test programs quickly. Using an
IDE, many of the tasks that involved tedious commands can now be

the optional <i>C++ Multimedia Cyber Classroom, 4/e,</i> by
providing a series of hands-on lab assignments designed to reinforce
students’ understanding of lecture material. This lab manual is
designed for closed laboratories, which are regularly scheduled classes
supervised by an instructor. Closed laboratories provide an excellent
learning environment because students can use concepts presented in
class to solve carefully designed lab problems. Instructors are better
able to gauge the students’ understanding of the material by monitoring
the students’ progress in lab. This lab manual also can be used for
open laboratories, homework and for self-study.</p>
            <p align="justify"> <i>C++ in the Lab</i> focuses on
Chapters 1–14 and 17 of <i> C++ How to Program, 4/e</i>. Each chapter
in the lab manual is divided into <i> Prelab Activities</i>, <i>Lab
Exercises</i> and <i>Postlab Activities</i>. Each chapter contains
objectives that introduce the lab’s key topics and an assignment
checklist that allows students to mark which exercises the instructor
has assigned. Each page in the lab manual is perforated, so students
can submit their answers (if required).</p>
            <p align="justify">Solutions to the lab manual’s <i>Prelab
Activities</i>, <i> Lab Exercises</i> and <i>Postlab Activities</i>

            <p align="justify">Prelab Activities are intended to be
completed by students after studying each chapter in <i>C++ How to
Program, 4/e</i>. <i>Prelab Activities</i> test students’
understanding of the material presented in the textbook, and prepare
students for the programming exercises in the lab session. (These
activities may be finished before or during lab, at the instructor’s
discretion.) The exercises focus on important terminology and
programming concepts and are effective for self-review. Prelab
Activities include <i>Matching Exercises</i>, <i>Fill-in-the-Blank
Exercises</i>, <i> Short-Answer Questions</i>, <i>Programming-Output
Exercises</i> (these ask students to determine what short code segment
do without actually running the program) and <i>Correct-the-Code

            <p align="justify"> <i><b>Lab Objectives</b></i> highlight
specific concepts on which the lab exercise focuses. </p>
            <p align="justify"> <i><b>Problem Descriptions</b></i>
provide the details of the exercise and hints to help students
implement the program. </p>
            <p align="justify"> <i><b>Sample Outputs</b></i>
illustrate the desired program behavior, which further clarifies the
problem descriptions and aids the students with writing programs. </p>
            <p align="justify"> <i><b>Program Templates</b></i> take
complete C++ programs and replace key lines of code with comments
describing the missing code. </p>
            <p align="justify"> <i><b>Problem-Solving Tips</b></i>
highlight key issues that students need to consider when solving the
lab exercises.</p>
            <p align="justify"> <i><b>Follow-Up Questions and
Activities</b></i> ask students to modify solutions to lab exercises,
write new programs that are similar to their lab-exercise solutions or
explain the implementation choices that were made when solving lab
exercises. </p>
            <p align="justify"> <i><b>Debugging Problems</b></i>
consist of a blocks of code that contain syntax errors and/or logic
errors. These alert students to the types of errors they are likely to
encounter while programming. </p>
            <p align="justify"><i><b>Postlab Activities</b></i></p>
            <p align="justify">Professors typically assign Postlab
Activities to reinforce key concepts or to provide students with more
programming experience outside the lab. Postlab Activities test the
students’ understanding of the Prelab and Lab Exercise material, and
ask students to apply the knowledge to creating programs from scratch.
The section provides two types of programming activities: coding
exercises and programming challenges. Coding exercises are short and
serve as review after the <i>Prelab Activities</i> and <i>Lab
Exercises</i> have been completed. These exercises ask students to
write programs or program segments using key concepts from the
textbook. Programming challenges allow students to apply the knowledge
they have gained in class to substantial programming exercises. Hints,
sample outputs and/or pseudocode are provided to aid students with
these problems. Students who complete the programming challenges for a
chapter successfully have indeed mastered the chapter material. Answers
to the programming challenges are available for download from <span class="cdt"><a href="http://www.deitel.com/">www.deitel.com</a></span>.</p>

            <p align="justify"><b><i>The C++ Multimedia Cyber
Classroom, 4/e, and The Complete C++ Training Course, 4/e</i></b></p>
            <p align="justify">We have updated our optional interactive
multimedia version of the book—The C++ Multimedia Cyber Classroom, 4/e
(CD for Windows<sup>®</sup>)—with considerable additional audio,
including the new material on Web Programming with CGI. This resource
is loaded with electronic features that are ideal for both learning and
reference. The <i>Cyber Classroom</i> is packaged with the textbook at
a discount in <i>The Complete C++ Training Course, 4/e</i>. If you
already have the book and would like to purchase the <i>C++ Multimedia
Cyber Classroom, 4/ e</i>, separately, please visit <span class="cdt"><a href="http://www.informit.com/cyberclassrooms">www.InformIT.com/cyberclassrooms</a></span>;
the ISBN number for this product is 0-13-100253-8. Deitel™ <i>Cyber
Classrooms</i> are generally available in CD and various popular
Web-based training formats.</p>
            <p align="justify">The CD provides an introduction in which
the authors overview the <i>Cyber Classroom</i>’s features. The
textbook’s 267 Live-Code™ example C++ programs truly "come alive" in
the <i>Cyber Classroom</i>. If you are viewing a program and want to
execute it, you simply click the lightning-bolt icon to run the
program. You immediately will see the program’s output. If you want to
modify a program and see the effects of your changes, simply clicking
the floppy-disk icon causes the source code to be "lifted off" the CD
and "dropped into" one of your own directories so you can edit the
code, recompile the program and try out your new version. Click the
audio icon to hear one of the authors "walk you through" the code. In
addition, the <i> Cyber Classroom</i> contains the full-text of <i>C++
How to Program, 4/e</i>, in fully-searchable format.</p>
            <p align="justify">The <i>Cyber Classroom</i> also
provides post-assessment exams (with answers) for each chapter in the
book. These exams are powerful features that allow users to gauge their
understanding of the programming concepts presented in the chapters.
Each exam question hyperlinks to the section in the book from which the
question was derived. This allows users to review the appropriate
chapter material before or after answering the question. A chart is
provided that summarizes the user’s exam results by chapter.</p>
            <p align="justify">The <i>Cyber Classroom</i> also
provides navigational aids, including extensive additional hyperlinking
for easy navigation. The <i>Cyber Classroom</i> is browser based, so
it remembers sections that you have visited recently and allows you to
move forward or backward among them. The thousands of index entries are
hyperlinked to their text occurrences. Furthermore, when you key in a
term using the "find" feature, the <i>Cyber Classroom</i> will locate
occurrences of that term throughout the text. The Table of Contents
entries are "hot," so clicking a chapter or section name takes you
immediately to that chapter or section. </p>
            <p align="justify">Students like the fact that solutions to
approximately half the exercises in the book are included with the <i>Cyber
Classroom</i>. Studying and running these extra programs is a nice way
for students to enhance their Live-Code™ learning experience.</p>
            <p align="justify">Students and professional users of our <i>Cyber
Classrooms</i> tell us that they like the interactivity and that the <i>Cyber
Classroom</i> is a powerful reference tool. We received an e-mail from
a person who said that he lives "in the boonies" and cannot take a live
course at a university, so the <i>Cyber Classroom</i> provided a nice
solution to his educational needs.</p>
            <p align="justify">Professors tell us that their students
enjoy using the <i> Cyber Classroom</i>, and consequently spend more
time on the courses, mastering more of the material than in
textbook-only courses. For a complete list of the available and
forthcoming <i>Cyber Classrooms</i> and <i>Complete Training Courses</i>,
