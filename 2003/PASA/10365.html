<h2>
Blocks</h2>
Donald wishes to send a gift to his new nephew, Fooey. Donald is a bit
of a traditionalist, so he has chosen to send a set of N classic baby blocks.
Each block is a cube, 1 inch by 1 inch by 1 inch. Donald wants to stack
the blocks together into a rectangular solid and wrap them all up in brown
paper for shipping. How much brown paper does Donald need?
<h4>
Input file - blocks.inp</h4>
The first line of input contains C, the number of test cases. For each
case there is an additional line containing N, the number of blocks to
be shipped. N does not exceed 1000.
<h4>
Output file - blocks.out</h4>
Your program should produce one line of output per case, giving the minimal
area of paper (in square inches) needed to wrap the blocks when they are
stacked together.
