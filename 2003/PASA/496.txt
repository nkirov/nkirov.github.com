                               Simply Subsets

After graduating from the University of Notre Dame, you obtained a job at
Top Shelf Software, Inc., as an entry-level computer engineer. On the first
day, your manager sits down with you and tasks you with the following job:
``We want to see how well you understand computer programming and the
abstract science behind it. As an evaluation for all of our new hires, we
require them to write a program to determine the relationship between pairs
of sets. I'm quite sure that you'll do well; my confidence is high. Here's
a list of requirements for what the program should do. Good luck.''

Input - subsets.inp

Your program should accept an even number of lines of text. Each pair of
lines will represent two sets; the first line represents set A, the second
line represents set B. Each line of text (set) will be a list of distinct
integers.

Output - subsets.out

After each pair of lines has been read in, the sets should be compared and
one of the following responses should be output:

   * A is a proper subset of B
   * B is a proper subset of A
   * A equals B
   * A and B are disjoint
   * I'm confused!
