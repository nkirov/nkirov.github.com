<p>Abstract.&nbsp;
<br>Bulgarian folklore music is an important part of Bulgarian cultural
heritage. The goal of this article is to describe briefly some achievements
in digitalization of music - music archives, methods and techniques; to
discuss what is done till now for Bulgarian folklore music and to outline
directions for future work.&nbsp; We give short descriptions of tools for
writing scores and mention special features of Bulgarian folklore music
concerning the process of digitalization.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bulgarian folklore music has many common characteristics
with the folklore music of other Balkan countries and the principles, methods
and technologies for digitalization of Bulgarian folklore music can be
used in other countries of south-eastern Europe.&nbsp;</td>

<h3>
&nbsp;<a NAME="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h3>
Current state of the art still distributes music either on paper or on
CD or similar media. However, the possibility to distribute music in several
other formats, such as digital audio and as images of music scores opens
several new directions for research. At the same time, Internet technologies
are changing the distribution mechanisms of music in important ways. The
main assignment for this is the digitalization of music.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What means digitalization of music?&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Digital audio (MIDI, MP3, other audio files),
full audio records or audio examples, different interpretations and performers.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Scores, sheet music (written in MusiXTeX, PMX,
etc.; presented in PDF, PostScript files, etc.), different arrangements.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Information (text,&nbsp; pictures) about authors,
pieces, instruments; sources, references.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Database, music archive, Internet publications.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this article we accentuate writing scores as
an important and difficult part of whole conception for music digitalization.
The information source is entirely available on the Internet.</td>

some control sequences, used mainly for the presentation of formulas. But
MusiXTeX source files are filled with macros to type musical marks, and
they look so complicated that many people hesitate at a glance. MusiXTeX
is not so easy, that's true. But once mastered, one can produce scores
of no less quality than the ones on market.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To simplify inputting instrumental music there is
the preprocessor PMX, which creates a TeX input file. For vocal music,
there is M-Tx, a preprocessor for PMX. These methods are used in <a href="#Werner Icking Music">Werner

Let us describe briefly Sibelius - complex music notation software.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The main features of Sibelius are: creating music,
composing and arranging, playback, page layout and part extraction, publishing
and Internet publishing.&nbsp;
<br>- <b>Creating music.</b>
<li>
&nbsp;MIDI input:&nbsp; Flexi-time™ is Sibelius's unique system for notating
music as it is played on a MIDI keyboard in real time.</li>

<li>
&nbsp;Mouse &amp; keystrokes: Pick note-values and accidentals from the
keypad with the mouse, and click to place them in the score.</li>

<li>
&nbsp;Scanning: Sibelius includes <a href="#PhotoScore">PhotoScore</a>™
Lite - the state-of-the-art program for scanning printed music.</li>

<li>
&nbsp;File conversion: Sibelius opens Finale™, SCORE™, Allegro™, PrintMusic™,
and MIDI files.</li>

<br>- <b>Composing and arranging.</b>
<li>
&nbsp;Text &amp; lyrics: Sibelius puts different types of text, such as
dynamics, titles and lyrics, in the appropriate font, size and position.
You can edit these text styles to change text consistently throughout the
score.</li>

<li>
&nbsp;Arrange™: Arrange is a feature to help with arranging and orchestration.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
&nbsp;Checking for mistakes: Sibelius saves the time by spotting all kinds
of&nbsp; mistakes such as rhythms which do not add up, or notes which are
too high/low to play. Sibelius knows every instrument's range, which it
can adjust for players of different abilities.</li>

<br>- <b>Playback.</b>
<li>
&nbsp;Playing back the score: Click the play button to hear the music.
Sibelius reads, understands and plays back all standard markings - including
trills, repeats, cresc./dim. hairpins, 8vas, glissandos, percussion and
drum sets, guitar tab, and even quarter-tones.</li>

<br>- <b>Page layout and part extraction</b>;&nbsp; Publishing and Internet
publishing.&nbsp;
<br><a NAME="Scorch"></a><b>Scorch</b>
<br>Sibelius Scorch is a free web browser plug-in that lets play, transpose,
change instruments, save and print Sibelius scores on the Internet.&nbsp;

Bulgarian folklore music</h3>
There are some difficulties in writing scores of Bulgarian folklore music.&nbsp;
<li>
&nbsp;Different notations of one and the same piece (song, melody or danceable
music) - written by different musicians, performs in different areas, changing
in the time.</li>

<li>
&nbsp;Several texts of one and the same song - the same argument.</li>

<li>
&nbsp;Irregular measures or lack of measure.</li>

<li>
&nbsp;Specific musical instruments - typical for Bulgarian folklore music.</li>

<li>
&nbsp;Language (Cyrillic letters or Latin letters) - no standard to write
in Bulgarian with Latin letters.</li>
