Load <a href="catalogue.html">catalogue.html</a> into your Web browser
for a hypertext catalogue of this CTAN archive.

These documents catalogue the TeX and related packages and systems
(mostly) available on CTAN. The source database in <a
href="catalogue.db">catalogue.db</a> is regularly updated and
maintained by <a href="http://www.dit.csiro.au/~gjw/gjw.html">Graham
Williams</a>.

The latest version is directly available from my home ftp archive <a
href="ftp://ftp.cbr.dit.csiro.au/staff/gjw/Catalogue/catalogue.db">
ftp://ftp.cbr.dit.csiro.au/staff/gjw/Catalogue/catalogue.db</a>.

The source database is atomatically converted to HTML (catalogue.html)
with short descriptions and hypertext links that take you to the
actual files/directories on the local CTAN host.  Links to alternative
CTAN hosts are also provided as are links to any available online
documentation.

A generic version of the Web document which links to the "well
connected" Walnut Creek archive in the US can be found at: <a
href="http://www.dit.csiro.au/~gjw/texpkgs.html">
http://www.dit.csiro.au/~gjw/texpkgs.html</a>.

Alternative versions, such as an index document, are also being worked
on and will appear on CTAN as they are developed.

Updates, contributions, suggestions for improvement, comments are all
welcome.

The texlive fields were added by Sebastian Rahtz to indicate the
"collection" which is part of the TeX Live CD-ROM.
