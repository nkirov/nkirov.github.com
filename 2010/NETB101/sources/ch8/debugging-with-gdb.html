<h1>Debugging C++ Programs Using "gdb"</h1>
<h2><font color="brown">Why use a debugger?</font></h2>
<p>
This might sound silly, but I've heard of many programmers that claim
they
do not need a debugger. They simply don't create bugs. Well, one thing
is sure - either they've no idea what they are saying, or they just
never
put their code to real test. Or maybe they're indeed as gifted as they
claim. Unfortunately, most of us tend to have bugs in our code. We
could
use printing commands to test our code, or we could use a debugger.
Many
times our code might seem to work correctly, because we didn't test it
under enough scenarios. Other times we know there's a bug, but by just
reading
the code we don't notice it is there. Thus, we should develop a habit
of launching a debugger when we get into trouble. It shouldn't come
instead
of making an effort to write correct code, to add many tests in the
code
for invalid function arguments, NULL pointers, etc. But when we're in
trouble, it's probably our best shot.
</p>
<p>
The explanations given here are specific to the "gdb" debugger, since
there
are no real standards regarding the activation and usage of debuggers,
but
once you know what features to expect from a debugger, it's not too
hard to adapt your knowledge to different debuggers.
</p>

<h2>Invoking the "gdb" debugger</h2>
</font>
<p>Before invoking the debugger. make sure you compiled your program
(all its
modules, as well as during linking) with the "-g" flag. Otherwise, life
will
be tough. Lets compile the "<a href="sqrtest2.cpp">sqrtest2.cpp</a>"
program,
and then invoke "gdb" to debug it:
<br>
</p>
<pre><code>c++ -g sqrtest2.cpp -o sqr<br>gdb sqr<br></code></pre>
Note that we run the program from the same directory it was compiled
in,
otherwise gdb won't find the source file, and thus won't be able to
show
us where in the code we are at a given point. It is possible to ask gdb
to
search for extra source files in some directory after launching it, but
for now, it's easier to just invoke it from the correct directory.
<hr size="4"><font color="brown">
<h2>Setting breakpoints</h2>
</font>
<p>The problem with just running the code is that it keeps on running
until
the program exits, which is usually too late. For this, breakpoints are
introduced. A break point is a command for the debugger to stop the
execution of the program before executing a specific source line.We can
set
break points using two methods:
</p>
<ol>
  <li> Specifying a specific line of code to stop in: <br>
    <pre><code><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">(gdb)</span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> break</span> 42</code><br></pre>
will insert a break point at line 42, in the for loop of the main
function. </li>
  <li> Specifying a function name, to break every time it is being
called: <br>
    <br>
    <code><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">(gdb)</span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> break</span> main </code> <br>
    <br>
this will set a break point right when starting the program (as the
function "main" gets executed automatically on the beginning of any C
or C++ program).</li>
  <li>We can get the list of all breakpoints:<br>
    <br>
    <code><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">(gdb)</span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"></span></code><code><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">info break</span></code> <br>
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">Num
Type&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Disp
Enb Address&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">1&nbsp;&nbsp;
breakpoint&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; keep y&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x08048a33 in
main at sqrtest2.cpp:42</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">2&nbsp;&nbsp;
breakpoint&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; keep y&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x08048a0c in
main at sqrtest2.cpp:41</span><br>
  </li>
</ol>
<hr size="4">
<font color="brown">
<h2>Stepping a command at a time</h2>
</font>
<p>So lets see, we've invoked gdb, set breakpoints, then typed:
<br>
</p>
<pre><code><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"></span></code><code><span
 style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">(gdb)</span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"></span></code><code><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> run</span><br></code></pre>
Then the debugger gave something like the following:
<br>
<pre><code>Breakpoint 2, main () at sqrtest2.cpp:41<br>41      /*41*/     for (x = 0; x &lt;= 10; x = x + 0.5)</code><br></pre>
<p>Now we want to start running the program slowly, step by step. There
are two
options for that:
</p>
<ol>
  <li> "<span style="font-weight: bold;">next</span>" - causes the
debugger to execute the current command, and
stop again, showing the next command in the code to be executed. </li>
  <li> "<span style="font-weight: bold;">step</span>" - causes the
debugger to execute the current command, and
if it is a function call - break at the beginning of that function.
This is useful for debugging nested code. </li>
</ol>
Now is your time to experiment with these options with our debug
program, and
see how they work. It is also useful to read the debuggers help, using
the
command "<span style="font-weight: bold;">help break</span>" and "<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">help breakpoints</span>" to learn how to
set several
breakpoints, how to see what breakpoints are set, how to delete
breakpoints,
and how to apply conditions to breakpoints (i.e. make them stop the
program
only if a certain expression evaluates to "true" when the breakpoint is
reached).
<hr size="4"><font color="brown">
<h2>Printing variables and expressions</h2>
</font>
<p>Without being able to examine variables contents during program
execution, the whole idea of using a debugger is quite lost. You can
print
the contents of a variable with a command like this:
<br>
<br>
</p>
<pre><code><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">(gdb)</span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"></span></code><code><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> </span></code><code><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">print</span> x<br></code><br></pre>
<p>And then you'll get a message like:
<br>
<br>
<code>
$1 = 0
</code><br>
<br>
which means that "x" contains the number "0".<br>
Note that this requires "x" to be in scope, or you'll get a message
such as:
<br>
<br>
<code>
No symbol "x" in current context.
</code><br>
<br>
For example, if you break inside the "squareroot" function and try to
print the value of "x", you'll get this message.
</p>
<p>
You may also try to print more complex expressions, like "xnew - xold",
or
"", and so on. In fact, you may
also use type casts, call functions found in the program, and whatever
your sick
mind could imagine (well, almost). Again, this is a good time to try
this
out.
</p>
<hr size="4">
<font color="brown">
<h2>Examining the function call stack</h2>
</font>
<p>Once we got into a break-point and examined some variables, we might
also
wish to see "where we are". That is, what function is being executed
now,
which function called it, and so on. This can be done using the
<code>"<span style="font-weight: bold;">where</span>"</code> command.
At the gdb command prompt, just type
"<span style="font-weight: bold;">where</span>",
and you'll see something like this:
<br>
</p>
<pre><code>#0  squareroot (a=0.5) at sqrtest2.cpp:31<br>#1  0x08048a41 in main () at sqrtest2.cpp:42<br></code></pre>
This means the currently executing function is "squareroot", at file
"sqrtest2.cpp", line 31. The function that called it is "main". We also
see which
arguments each function had received. If there were more functions in
the call
chain, we'd see them listed in order. This list is also called "a stack
trace", since it shows us the structure of the execution stack at this
point
in the program's life.
<p>Just as we can see contents of variables in the current function, we
can
see contents of variables local to the calling function, or to any
other
function on the stack. For example, if we want to see the contents of
variable "x" in function "main", we can type the following two
commands:
<br>
</p>
<pre><code><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">(gdb)</span> <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">frame</span> 1<br>#1  0x08048a41 in main () at sqrtest2.cpp:42<br>42      /*42*/     {  double y = squareroot(x);<br><span
 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">(gdb)</span> <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">print</span> x<br>$4 = 0.5<br></code></pre>
The "<span style="font-weight: bold;">frame</span>" command tells the
debugger to switch to the given stack
frame
('0' is the frame of the currently executing function). At that stage,
any
print command invoked will use the context of that stack frame.
Of-course, if
we issue a "<span style="font-weight: bold;">step</span>" or "<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">next</span>" command, the program will
continue at the
top
frame, not at the frame we requested to see. After all, the debugger
cannot
"undo" all the calls and continue from there.<br>
<br>
To exit gdb type:<br>
<pre><code><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">(gdb)<span
 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> quit</span></span></code></pre>
<hr size="4"><font color="brown">
<h2>Debugging a crashed program</h2>
</font>
<p>One of the problems about debugging programs, has to do with
Murphy's law:
<em>A program will crash when least expected</em>. This phrase just
means
that after you take the program out as production code, it will crash.
And
the bugs won't necessarily be easy to reproduce. Luckily, there is some
aid for us, in the image of "core files".
</p>
<p>
A core file contains the memory image of a process, and (assuming the
program
within the process contains debug info) its stack trace, contents of
variables,
and so on. A program is normally set to generate a core file containing
its memory image when it crashes due to signals such as SEGV or BUS.
Provided
that the shell invoking the program was not set to limit the size of
this core
file, we will find this file in the working directory of the process
(either
the directory from which it was started, or the directory it last
switched to
using the <code>chdir</code> system call).
</p>
<p>
Once we get such a core file, we can look at it by issuing the
following
command:
<br>
<br>
</p>
<pre><code><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">(gdb)</span></code><code> /path/to/program/sqr core<br></code><br></pre>
<p>This assumes the program was launched using this path, and the core
file is
in the current directory. If it is not, we can give the path to the
core
file. When we get the debugger's prompt (assuming the core file was
successfully
read), we can issue commands such as "<span style="font-weight: bold;">print</span>",
"<span style="font-weight: bold;">where</span>" or "<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">frame </span>X". We
can not
issue commands that imply execution (such as "<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">next</span>", or the invocation
of
function calls). In some situations, we will be able to see what caused
the crash.
</p>
<p>
One should note that if the program crashed due to invalid
memory address access, this will imply that the memory of the program
was corrupt, and thus that the core file is corrupt as well, and thus
contains bad memory contents, invalid stack frames, etc. Thus, we
should
see the core file's contents as one possible past, out of many probable
pasts (this makes core file analysis rather similar to quantum theory.
almost).

<h2>Getting more info about debugging</h2>
</font>
<p>It is now probably time to go play around with your programs and
your debugger.
It is suggested to try "<span style="font-weight: bold;">help</span>"
inside gdb, to learn more about its
commands.
Especially the "<span style="font-weight: bold;">dir</span>" command,
that enables debugging programs whose
source code
is split over several directories.
