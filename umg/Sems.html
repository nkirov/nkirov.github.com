<p>This work was supported by VW-Project "`Iterative Techniques for Convection-Diffusion
Problems on locally refined meshes''
</p>
<p><b>Abstract</b>. A brief overview of triangle and tetrahedral meshing
algorithms is presented. Also included some comments about smoothing, clean-up
and refinement procedures. Short descriptions of 2D and 3D mesh generation
codes, <b><tt>Triangle</tt></b> and <b><tt>QMG</tt></b>, are given. We
use the streamline-diffusion finite element method for solving convection
diffusion boundary valued problems on triangle and tetrahedral meshes.
An implementation with piecewise linear trial functions in MATLAB environment
is presented. Two types of numerical results illustrate the mesh generators
and the finite element solver - boundary layers on the unite square and
unite cube, and a complicated geometry domain in 3D.
