<h2><a name="1"></a> 1. History and Special Features</h2><br>
Common Lisp, commonly abbreviated CL, is a dialect of the Lisp programming language, published in ANSI standard X3.226-1994. Developed to standardize the divergent variants of Lisp which predated it, it is not an implementation but rather a language specification. Several implementations of the Common Lisp standard are available, including commercial products and open source software
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="2"></a>2. "Hello World" Program and comment operator ";"</h2><br>
<blockquote>
(print "Hello World!")
;;Hello World!
<br>
Note: Common Lisp ignores the comment operator (;) and everything after it on the line
<br>
</blockquote>
<h2><a name="3"></a>3. Fundamental data dypes and Assignment operator</h2><br>
Common Lisp has many data types, more than many other languages.<br><br>


<h3><a name="3.1"></a>3.1Variable Environments</h3>
<br>
<blockquote>
(let ( {symbol | (symbol form)}*) <r>special form</r><br>
[(declare (special variables))]<br>
forms)<br>
</blockquote>
Establishes each symbol as the name of a variable. The scope of each
of these variables is limited to the let form, unless it is named in the declaration, in which case that variable has dynamic scope. If a form is given with a symbol, the value of the form becomes the initial value of
the variable named by the symbol. These forms are evaluated in order,
but the assignment of their values to their variables is done in parallel.
A variable without an initialization form is initialized to NIL. Variables
named in the declaration that are not established by this let form are
special variables established elsewhere that will be used in the forms of
this let. After the establishment and initialization of all the variables,
the forms are evaluated in order, and the value of the last one becomes
the value of the let form.<br>
<blockquote>
(let* ( {symbol | (symbol form)}*)   special form<br>
[(declare (special variables))]<br>
forms)
</blockquote>
<br>
Exactly like let except that the assigning of initial values to the variables
is done in order so that one variable may be used in the initialization
form of a later variable.
<h3><a name="3.2"></a> 3.2Assignment </h3>
<br>
<blockquote>
(psetf {place form}*) ;;macro
</blockquote>
Just like setf, except evaluates all the forms first, then assigns the
values to the corresponding places in parallel. Returns NIL.
<br>
<blockquote>
(psetq {symbol form}*) ;;macro
</blockquote>
<br>
Just like setq, except evaluates all the forms first, then assigns the
values to the corresponding variables in parallel. Returns NIL.
<br>
<blockquote>
(set symbol form) ;;function
</blockquote>
<br>
Binds the special (dynamic) variable named symbol to the value of form.
<br>
<blockquote>
(setf {place form}*) ;;macro
</blockquote>
<br>
Evaluates the first form and stores its value in the generalized variable
specified by the first place, then goes on to the next place form pair,
and so on. Returns the value of the last form.
<br>
<blockquote>
(setq {symbol form}*) ;;special form
</blockquote>
<br>
Evaluates the first form and stores its value in the variable named by the
first symbol (which is not evaluated), then goes on to the next symbol
form pair, and so on. Returns the value of the last form.
<br>
<br>
<h3><a name="3.3"></a>3.3Sequences</h3>
<br>
<blockquote>
(prog1 forms) ;;macro
</blockquote>
The forms are evaluated in order and the value of the first is returned.<br>

<blockquote>
(prog2 forms) ;;macro
</blockquote>
<br>
The forms are evaluated in order and the value of the second is returned.<br>
<blockquote>
(progn [forms]) ;;special form

</blockquote>
<br>
The forms are evaluated in order and the value of the last is returned.<br>
<h3><a name="3.4"></a>3.4Exits</h3>

<blockquote>
(return [form]) ;;macro
</blockquote>
<br>
form is evaluated and exit is made from the lexically innermost dolist,
dotimes, or loop form. The value of form is returned by that form. If
form is omitted, NIL is returned.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="4"></a>4. Basic Control Flow (conditional and loop statements)</h2>
<h3><a name="4.1"></a>4.1Conditional operators</h3>
<blockquote>
(case form ;;macro<br>
((objects1) forms1)<br>
...<br>
((objectsn) formsn))
</blockquote>
<br>
form is evaluated. If its value is among the objectsi, then the formsi are
evaluated and the value of the last formsi is returned as the value of the
call to case. The objectsi are not evaluated. If the value of form is not
among any of the objectsi, NIL is returned unless either t or otherwise
appears instead of (objectsn), in which case the formsn are evaluated
and the value of the last formsn is returned. If objectsi consists of only
one object, that object may appear without the surrounding parentheses
as long as it is not nil, t, otherwise, or a cons. It is an error for one
object to appear among more than one objectsi.
<br>
<blockquote>
(cond (test1 [forms1]) ... (testn [formsn])) ;;special form<br>
</blockquote>
<br>
Evaluates the testi in order until one of them, testj say, evaluates to
True. Then evaluates formsj and returns the value of the last one. If
there are no formsj, the value of testj is returned. If no testi evaluates
to True, NIL is returned.<br>
<blockquote>
(if test then [else]) ;;special form<br>
</blockquote>
If test evaluates to True, evaluates and returns the value of then; otherwise,
if else is present, evaluates and returns the value of else; otherwise,
returns NIL.
<blockquote>
(typecase form (type1 forms1) ... (typen formsn)) ;;macro
<br>
</blockquote>
form is evaluated. formsi are evaluated for the lowest i for which the
value of form is of type typei and the value of the last formsi is returned
as the value of the call to typecase. The typei are not evaluated. If
the value of form is not any of the typei, NIL is returned unless either
t or otherwise appears instead of (typen), in which case the formsn
are evaluated and the value of the last formsn is returned.
<br>
<blockquote>
(unless test forms) ;;macro
<br>
</blockquote>
Evaluates test. If the value is NIL, evaluates the forms in order and
returns the value of the last one. Otherwise, does not evaluate the
forms and returns NIL.
<br>
<blockquote>
(when test forms) ;;macro
<br>
</blockquote>
Evaluates test. If the value is NIL, does not evaluate the forms and
returns NIL. Otherwise, evaluates the forms in order and returns the
value of the last one.
<br>
<br>
<h3><a name="4.2"></a>4.2Loop operators</h3>

In these three macros, a statement is a non-atomic (that is, a list) form.<br>
<blockquote>
(dolist (symbol list-form [result-form]) statements) ;;macro
<br>
</blockquote>
<br>
Evaluates statements repeatedly with symbol successively bound to the
members of the value of list-form (which must evaluate to a list). Then
evaluates result-form, and returns that value. If result-form is omitted,
dolist returns NIL. Premature exit may be made with an explicit
return form.<br>
<blockquote>
(dotimes (symbol form resultform) statements) ;;macro
<br>
</blockquote>
<br>
Evaluates statements repeatedly with symbol successively bound to the
integers zero, 1, and so on, up to, but not including, the value of form,
which should evaluate to an integer. Then resultform is evaluated and
its value is returned. If form evaluates to zero or to a negative integer,
the statements are not evaluated at all. Premature exit may be made
with an explicit return form.<br>
<blockquote>
(loop statements) ;;macro
<br>
</blockquote>
<br>
The statements are evaluated in order repeatedly forever. The only way
to exit a loop is to evaluate a return that is lexically within the loop
form.
<br>
<br>



<h2><a name="5"></a>5. Functions</h2><br>
<br>
In common lisp functions are divided into types as follows :
<br>
<h3><a name="5.1"></a>5.1Constructors</h3>
<br>
<blockquote>
(function fn) ;;special form
</blockquote>
If fn is a symbol, returns the function named by that symbol. If fn is
a lambda expression, returns the functional closure of that expression.
An alternate printed representation of (function fn) is #’fn.
<br>
<h3><a name="5.2"></a>5.2Operators</h3>
<br>
<blockquote>
(apply function [forms1] ([forms2])) ;;function
</blockquote>
A list of forms1 is appended to the list of forms2, and the function is
applied to that list of argument forms. If a symbol is given instead of a
function, the function the symbol names is used.
<br>
<blockquote>
(funcall function [forms]) function
</blockquote>
Applies the function to the argument forms. function may only be a
function; it can’t be a macro or a special form.
<br>
<br>
<h3><a name="5.3"></a>5.3Mapping Functions</h3>
<br>
<blockquote>
(mapc function lists) ;;function
<br>
</blockquote>
<br>
There must be the same number of lists as the number of arguments
function takes. function is applied to the first member of each of the
lists, the second member, and so on, until the shortest list is exhausted.
The first of the lists is returned.
<br>
<blockquote>
(mapcan function lists) ;;function
<br>
</blockquote>
function must return a list, and there must be the same number of lists
as the number of arguments function takes. function is applied to the
first member of each of the lists, the second member, and so on, until
the shortest list is exhausted. The nconc of the values is returned.
<br>
<blockquote>
(mapcar function lists) ;;function
<br>
</blockquote>
There must be the same number of lists as the number of arguments
function takes. function is applied to the first member of each of the
lists, the second member, and so on, until the shortest list is exhausted.
A list of the values is returned.
<br>
<br>

<h3><a name="5.4"></a>5.4Utility Functions</h3>
<br>
<blockquote>
(assert assertion [(variables1) [string variables2]]) ;;macro
<br>
</blockquote>
If the form assertion evaluates to True, returns NIL. Otherwise, an
error is forced and Lisp prints an error message and gives the user the
choice of aborting the computation or replacing the current values of
the variables listed as variables1. If the user chooses to replace the
current values, the assert form is retried with the new values. The
error message is formed, in part, by applying format to string and
variables2.<br>
<blockquote>
(check-type variable type-specifier) ;;macro
<br>
</blockquote>
<br>
If the variable is of the type specified by the type-specifier, returns NIL.
Otherwise, an error is forced and Lisp prints an error message and gives
the user the choice of aborting the computation or replacing the current
value of variable. If the user chooses the latter, the check-type form
is retried with the new value.
<br>
<blockquote>
(deftype symbol () doc-string ’(satisfies function)) ;;macro
<br>
</blockquote>
<br>
Defines symbol to be the name of Common Lisp type consisting of
all those objects that satisfy the predicate function, which must be
a function of one argument. doc-string is retrievable from symbol by
documentation. The form (satisfies function) may be replaced by
any type-specifier that might be used in check-type (see above), in
which case the type named by symbol is the type specified by typespecifier.
<br>
<blockquote>
(time form) ;;macro
<br>
</blockquote>
Evaluates form and prints how long it took to do the evaluation. Returns
the value of form.
<br>
<blockquote>
(trace [function-names]) ;;macro
<br>
</blockquote>

Turns on tracing of the specified functions (function-names are not evaluated.)
With no arguments, returns a list of all functions being traced.
<br>
<blockquote>
(untrace [function-names]) ;;macro
<br>
</blockquote>
Turns off tracing of the specified functions (function-names are not evaluated.)
With no arguments, turns off all tracing.

<br>
<br>

<h3><a name="5.5"></a>5.5Input/Output</h3>
<br>
<blockquote>
(format stream control-string arguments) ;;function
<br>
</blockquote>
<br>
Produces a printed representation of its arguments, as specified by the
control-string. If stream is nil, this printed representation is returned
as a string. If stream is t, the printed representation is printed to the
standard output file (usually the terminal). control-string is a string
of characters that get printed as they appear in the string, intermixed
with format directives. Some format directives consume arguments and
specify how these arguments are printed. Other format directives do
not consume arguments, but control the printing in other ways. Nonconsuming
directives include
<br>
<br>
<blockquote>
~% Causes a newline to be printed.
~& Causes a newline to be printed unless printing is already at the
beginning of a new line
~~ Causes the character ~ to be printed.
~#\newline A ~ appearing in the control-string right before the end
of a line causes the end-of-line and all subsequent blanks to be
ignored. It is a way of splitting a long control-string over several
lines.
</blockquote>
<br>
Some consuming format directives are
<br>
<blockquote>
~a or ~A Consumes one argument and prints it without escape characters,
as princ would
~s or ~S Consumes one argument and prints it with escape characters,
as prin1 would
~{str~} Consumes one argument, which must be a list, and prints the
members of the list according to the control string str as if they
were arguments to an embedded call of format. If str doesn’t
consume all the members of the list, it is used again on the next
group, and so on.
~#[str1~:;str2~] Uses the control string str1 if there is no argument
left or the control string str2 if there is any argument left. If
this directive is embedded in the ~ {str ~ } directive, the notion of
“argument” is replaced by “member” of the list.
<br>
</blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote>
(fresh-line [stream]) ;;function
<br>
</blockquote>
Outputs a newline to stream, which defaults to standard output and
returns T, but only if output is not already positioned at the beginning
of a new line. In that case, it does nothing and returns NIL.
<br>
<blockquote>
(pprint object [stream]) ;;function
</blockquote>
Prints a newline and then prints the object using escape characters
as appropriate and in a “pretty” indented format. Returns no value.
Printing is done into stream, which defaults to the standard output.
<br>
<blockquote>
(prin1 object [stream]) ;;function
</blockquote>
Prints the object using escape characters as appropriate. Returns object.
Printing is done into stream, which defaults to the standard output.
<br>
<blockquote>
(princ object [stream]) ;;function
</blockquote>
Prints the object without using escape characters. Returns object. Printing
is done into stream, which defaults to the standard output.
<br>
<blockquote>
(print object [stream]) ;;function
</blockquote>
Prints the object using escape characters as appropriate, preceded by
a newline and followed by a space. Returns object. Printing is done
into stream, which defaults to the standard output.
<br>
<blockquote>
(read [stream]) ;;function
</blockquote>
Reads one S-expression from the input stream, which defaults to standard
input, and returns the object represented by that S-expression.
<br>
<blockquote>
(terpri [stream]) ;;function
</blockquote>
Outputs a newline to stream, which defaults to standard output and
returns NIL.
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="6"></a>6. Arrays - syntax, definition, example</h2>
In common lisp arrays have two major sections:
<h3><a name="6.1"></a>6.1Constructors</h3>
<br>
<blockquote>
(make-array n) ;;function
</blockquote>
Creates and returns an array of n elements, indexed from 0 to n &#8722; 1.
Each element can be any Common Lisp object.
<h3><a name="6.2"></a>6.2Selectors</h3>
<br>
<blockquote>
(aref array i) ;;function
</blockquote>
Returns the ith element of array. i must be a nonnegative integer less
than the number of elements of array. Indexing is zero-based. That is,
the first element of array is retrieved with (aref array 0). Forms a
generalized variable recognizable by setf.
